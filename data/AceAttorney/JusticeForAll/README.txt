# Ace Attorney

Metadata and checking by PVC.

The transcripts for the games themselves are also sourced from the Ace Attorney fandom wiki, and we express our thanks to them for their hard work.


Characters are sometimes named "???" before their names are revealed. This is still to be resolved (potentially automatically, looking at other characters with dialogue in the scene, identifying name that appears after but not before the ???).


## Gender coding

"neutral" has been used fairly liberally and refers to speakers that are either:

-  Non-human, whether they be animals ("Polly" the parrot), puppets ("Trilo" the ventriloquist doll) or objects ("TV", "Ray gun", etc.)
-  Humans that are impossible to gender, mostly due to a lack of a visual counterpart. Instances include "Teacher" and "Announcer"

Background characters such as "Bailiff", "Officer" and "Programmer" I have assumed to be male based on spritework and context clues.


On narrative role assignments:

These are based on the assignments by the Ace Attorney fandom wiki, specifically the ones shown on this page (https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_game_episodes),* however:

- I have not included the assignments for cases that do not occur in the present, A.K.A DL-6 and SL-9, because we do not see these cases play out in the games themselves.
- Further, I have not included Lana Skye in the "prosecutor" category. This is because, while it is her profession, she do not 'act' as prosecutor (i.e. stand at the bench and prosecute) at any point in the game. Grossberg does stand at the defense bench as an assistant-lawyer, meanwhile, and thus is considered a "defence attorney".
- I have not included a "witness" role for several reasons, but this would probably refer to most characters that have not otherwise been coded.
- I have also not included an "investigator" role because this would only refer to one character (Dick Gumshoe).
- Most roles assignments are based on frequency/consistency. For instance, Edgeworth and Godot both appear as defence attorneys in sections of the trilogy, but only once. The rest of the time they act as prosecutors, so it would be wrong to categorise them as defence attorneys.
- That being said, I have been more generous with the "assistant" category, instead referring to anyone who assists the main character in the trial sections of the game at some point in time.
- The "culprit" role only refers to the main culprit (the one responsible for the murder) and does not include accomplices. The only exception is Matt Engarde, who technically orchestrates a murder by hiring a hitman.
- The "victim" category only includes victims that have dialogue.


##  Aliases

The main alias is their 'true identity' or the name they use most often in the case of Godot (Diego Armando).
