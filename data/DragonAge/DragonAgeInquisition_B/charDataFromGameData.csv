He responds well to people who are intelligent and clever, and thinks less of people who are thuggish and crude.

Note that some of his lines are marked ""ancient times"", which is when Solas is remembering something profound he experienced in the Fade. These lines are written with a specific cadence. They should NOT be sung or forced into a sing-song voice pattern, but knowing that there is a bit of rhythm there might help the actor.",,Welsh,Elf,,,Major,Graham22k_HQ,,,23,False,True,
65ca43d3-b981-7edf-b2d9-aeead0bfee40,,global/Followers/Cole,Cole,Cole,Male,"Cole appears to be a young man, shy and uncertain, who speaks with odd non sequitors that don't always make a ton of sense. In reality, however, Cole is a spirit who has crossed into this world, and who is trying to find out whether he is a spirit, a demon, or a real person.

Cole is first and foremost compassionate. He cares about people and cannot bear to see harm come to them. He tries to help people in the most direct (and often least beneficial, long-term) way possible. Most of the time, Cole hides from everyone -- most people cannot see him, or forget him after they interact with him, thanks to innate magic on Cole's part. He is only remembered by people important to him.

He thinks in terms of feelings and emotions, often unconsciously reading the feelings of others (though never in a way concrete enough to let the player really take advantage of it), so a lot of times, he'll be speaking thoughts that aren't his. He also uses synesthesia at times -- thinking of how a feeling tastes, or smells, or sounds. When he focuses enough to say something simple and direct, it is often an effort.

In his follower plot, Cole can be urged more toward the Spirit or Human side of things, which results in him either becoming more gentle and free-form in his thoughts, or more human and grounded.

Cole has a few distinct flavors that show up in almost all scenes. Iâve marked lines with these as a useful shorthand to give general voice feeling, although most lines will also have a specific context that should be respected as well:

Sensory: On these lines, Cole is either trying to interpret something outside the realm of human understanding or is reading someoneâs minds. These are going to have a lot of weird sensory crossover. Treat all punctuation here as essentially optional. Cole may be talking in a happy dreamy voice or rattling something off with urgent intensity, depending on the scene, but itâs always going to have this disjointed, run-on-sentence feeling to it, and the actor should run with that and use whatever read works best.

Empathic: On these lines, Cole is getting into someone elseâs mind, either lightly (in which case he might say, âShe sees the body on the tableâ) or deeply (in which case he would say, âI see the body on the table,â talking from the point of view of the person heâs reading). These often go along with the sensory lines, but Iâll try to mark them specifically for when weird pronoun usage pops up.

More Spirit: Lines marked âSpirit Onlyâ or âMore Spiritâ can sound a bit more flowing and loose, as though Cole is looking calmly and distantly at whatever is happening. Individual lines will have specific reads, of course, but in general, Cole as a spirit is much calmer and more relaxed about everything.

More Human: Lines marked âHuman Onlyâ or âMore Humanâ should have Cole sounding as close to ânormalâ as he gets. He usually makes more sense, and whether heâs offering normal advice or arguing or whatever, he should sound very close to ânormal person saying thisâ, with little of the free-association rambling that marks his other lines.",,Lower class British,Human,"A nondescript young man in a floppy shapeless hat, thin and always in motion.

Most Qunari speak in a flat, reserved tone, but Iron Bull breaks the stereotype. He is boisterous, good-natured, confident, and relaxed. He's a guy who is always happy to indulge his appetites, whether you're talking food, drink, or women. It would be easy for him to come off as a thug, but he's just so damn likeable and charismatic that he pulls it off. Picture a former athlete who retired a couple of years ago and is now doing sideline commentary, happy to joke around and still confident that he could get out there and play if he wanted to.

Iron Bull is almost always casual. It's difficult to scare him (unless demons are involved), and the most you're going to get by way of disagreement is a wordless ""Oh, you gotta be kidding me"" grumble like you'd from somebody who just stepped in dog poop.

Most of this casual attitude comes from the fact that Iron Bull was essentially part of the secret police in his former life. He doesn't hide it, but in his life as a mercenary who occasionally sends reports, he's hiding FROM it. That grim resolve and constant paranoia burned him out, and he's afraid that if he takes things too seriously again, he'll just find more disappointment.

Her cousin is the reigning Empress, Celene, who charmed the Council of Heralds into granting 
her the throne even though she was the youngest of the three heirs. Even her name belongs to 
someone more important â Florianne was named for her uncle, Emperor Florian, in a bid by 
her mother to curry favor.

overshadowed, overlooked. The court sees her as important, but not too important.

Everyone likes her, but no one takes her seriously. She is invited everywhere, and rarely noticed. 

And she uses that to her advantage.

She is the Saruman to Corypheusâ Sauron. Manipulated into betraying her own side, she 
believes that when Corypheus ascends to godhood, she will rule the mortal world. She 
thinks she has a partnership with Corypheus, when in fact, she is simply a puppet.
