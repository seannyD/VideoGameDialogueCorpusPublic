If you will accept this quest to find this tome, I will give you _upfront_ gold pieces now and another _gold_ gold pieces when you return. Do we have a deal then, %pcf?","Good. I'll give you =queston_ days to get the book out of ___mondung_ and return. After that time, the _gold_ gold pieces will be forfeit. The name of the book is _book_. Good luck, %pcf.",Very well. I'll look for a different mercenary then.
K0C00Y09#_qgiver_,male,"My former partner here at __qgiver_, a _enemy_, has taken more than %g3 fair share of our profits and run away from ___qgiver_. Now, I'm not the vengeful sort, but I would appreciate it if you would bring the _enemy_ back to me, so I can get some explanation for this remarkable behavior. I'll pay you _gold_ gold pieces for %g2 alive, and _lessgold_ gold if you accidentally kill %g2. // That damnable _enemy_ let me trust %g2, led me merrily along, and then left without a word but with a sizeable portion of my savings. Now the money does bother me, but not as much as the betrayal. I want you to track %g2 down, and bring %g2 to me, and I'm willing to pay _gold_ gold pieces for it. Are you willing and able? // I am looking for a manhunter, or, more specifically, a _enemy_ hunter. You see, %g left town without paying the gold %g owes me. It's the principle of the thing. I don't mind paying you _gold_ gold pieces for %g3 capture, but my reputation would be ruined if I let my debtors just leave ___qgiver_, owing me gold. Will you get this deadbeat for me?","Good. The _enemy_'s name is =enemy_, and rumor has it that %g is holed up in ___mondung_ for =queston_ days at most. That will be the deadline by which I expect to hear from you. Remember -- =enemy_ is a tough _enemy_, so expect a fight, but try not to kill %g2. I want %g2 alive, not dead. Good luck, %pcf. // That's fine then. My sources tell me that the _enemy_ has taken refuge in ___mondung_ and will probably be there for =queston_ days or so. I fully expect =enemy_, that's the _enemy_'s name, to put up a fight, but try not to kill %g2. I will expect you back in =queston_ days. Good luck. // Frightfully good of you, %pcf. I've made some inquiries and it seems that our _enemy_ friend is lurking about the vicinity of ___mondung_, unguarded and alone except for the usual brutes in residence. =enemy_ is %g3 name and I will expect %g2 before me in =queston_ days, preferably alive. Don't disappoint me.","No? Well, I'll just go down to the Fighters Guild and hire someone else. // That's too bad. Let me know if you change your mind."
K0C01Y00#_qgiver_,random,"Imagine the purity of my delight when my sniveling, cheating lover of the past two years was abducted and presumably killed. Then imagine my despair when I discovered that the =victim_ was still among the living. Next, imagine my amusement when %g3 kidnappers demanded a ransom. Finally, please imagine my annoyance when %g3 cousin actually agreed to pay the ransom. This cannot be. I need someone to make certain that the ransoming fails. Will you help me?","%oth, %oth, and %oth. The way I see it, there are three ways to stop this ransoming. One is to make sure that dear _victim_ accidentally dies before the ransom date in =queston1_ days. Of course, I don't know where %g is, so that's a difficult one. The next option is to see to %g3 cousin's accidental death within the same time frame. Now, =cousin_, that's the cousin, lives in ___mondung2_, which is a well-fended fortress. So there's a difficulty there. Finally, you could remove the _gem_ from ___mondung2_ that =cousin_ plans to use for the ransom.

I will gladly tell you what I know about it, if you will find a particular rare scroll for me. This is not the type of job I could give to the Fighters Guild, for the scroll is protected by some powerful daedra spirits and has the power to summon creatures from the plane of Oblivion. Go to ___mondung_, find the scroll, and bring it back to me before =queston_ days have passed and I will tell you what I know about the tempest that nearly destroyed you.","That's funny.

A nest of harpies has moved into an old property of mine, and while I personally couldn't care less, our wise and benevolent %rt has decreed that the owner of any structure infested by harpies is responsible for extermination. There is apparently a fine involved for noncompliance. Frankly, I don't have the time for this; but if you wouldn't mind bloodying your sword a bit, I could use your help. The last mercenary I hired didn't make it, so I would understand if you're hesitant. I'd be happy to pay you, say, _reward_ gold pieces for your trouble.","Would you? Marvelous. Now, the catch is that I must have proof that a serious effort has been made to clear out ___mondung_ in =2mondung_ days. Obviously that does not leave a lot of time. I had hoped that _contact_, the mercenary I had hired earlier from the Fighters Guild would have been more capable. And, listen, %pcf, you don't have to clear out all ___mondung_. Just kill four or five of the critters and get back here. I know! The clan leaders wear specially dyed gryphon's feathers. Bring back one of those and I'll have the proof I need.

I loaned a certain sum of money to a noble by the name of _patsy_, who you may or may not have heard of. The security on the loan was the deed to a valuable piece of property. Now _patsy_ and the deed have both vanished. Rumor has it that %g fell on some hard time financially, but the sum I loaned is not easily swallowed by my enterprises. Tangling with the likes of _patsy_ will likely be dangerous, but I need a champion. Will you help me, my friend, in exchange for a large uncut diamond?","That's good to hear. Now then, I have thirty days before I will be forced to dip into my capital. The deed was stolen out of a local establishment called _bank_ in __bank_ together with some other valuables, but the coincidence between _patsy_'s disappearance at the same time the deed did merits investigation. _patsy_'s old residence was _house2_ in __house2_, which I understand is now empty. Other than that, I have no leads. I either need the gold _patsy_ borrowed, the deed to the house, or that aristocrat's head on a stick in thirty days. Don't let me down, %pcf.","I am sorry to hear that. I understand, of course, but it is disappointing."

As it turns out, %g3 knowledge of genealogy was lacking, and %g sang a song about an incestuous duke to %g3 new patroness, the duke's daughter. Interested in accounting this uncouth artiste for _reward_ gold pieces?","I thought it would appeal. Apparently, the bard is aware of our contract and is hiding in a dismal hole called ___mondung_.

The poor girl did the only thing she could do, and now we have some accounting to do. You're interested, I take it?","As I thought. We think the knight does not yet know about the contract, being deeply entrenched in a fortress called ___mondung_. Obviously, this ill-bred warrior doesn't want to make this too easy on us.

L0B30Y03#_questgiver_,random,"I recognize your expression, %pcf. You are growing arrogant, egotistical, and vain. It's wonderful to see.

Are you up for it?","You don't disappoint me, %pcf. Yes, we have been asked to account this wizard, who by the way is no sparkcaster.

M0B00Y15#_qgiver_,male,"I am _qgiver_. I have a relatively menial job, if you are willing to take it.

Seems _dummy_ has this pet sabertooth tiger -- don't ask -- and it ran off a few days ago. %g had it tracked to ___mondung_, but now we need someone to go in there and bring it out. Alive. The trick is that it's been trained to respond to this bell. The tiger should become docile if you ring the bell in its face. Of course, _dummy_ did say it isn't trained too well -- are you surprised? -- so you may have to smack it upside the head once or twice to get its attention. Just don't kill it, OK? Bring it back to _dummy_ at __dummy_ in one piece within =qtime_ days, and %g'll pay you _gold_ gold. Good luck.","Yeah, you're right, I did say this job needed brains didn't I?"

Pay is pretty standard, _reward_ gold pieces. You up for it?","Good deal, %pcf. Our client places the giants at their stronghold, ___mondung_. He says there are six of 'em, and he ain't gonna pay unless all six are stiffed, and in =1stparton_ days. Got it, %pcf? Good.","Awright, whatever. Sounded like your kind of thing is all."

Listen, knock off that Daedroth and get back here in =1stparton_ days for your reward. I don't know how long that thing's gonna be around, so you're gonna want to move your ass.

M0B30Y04#_questgiver_,male,"Listen, %pcf, if you hadn't already done a bunch of jobs for us already, I wouldn't even suggest this, but there's a job I don't even want to tell you about.

Are you willing to take this on?","Her husband is a zombie. He hides out somewhere during day. She never sees him in _house_ then. At night he wanders around the place. Put him out of his misery and get back here in =2dung_ days, and it's worth _gold_ gold to you.",Too bad. Normally only the temples get jobs like this. You've passed up a good one %pcn.

M0B50Y09#_qgiver_,male,"A certain merchant needs to have a monster, a gargoyle to be precise, dispatched. The pay is a modest _gold_ gold pieces. Can I have your help in this matter?",It seems this merchant hired a wizard to build him a grand mansion. Then the poor fool tried to cheat the mage of his wages. The wizard grew angry and animated one of the stone gargoyles on the new mansion. It has been attacking the merchant ceaselessly. Go out to ___dungeon_ and kill the thing.

I'm working on a formula that calls for a ""goodly piece of =mummy_. What is a =mummy_? An herb? A mineral? Well, I've researched the matter and found =mummy_ is a mummy. Imagine that. And this particularly mummy is right here in %reg. Could I talk you into going to its tomb and grabbing a piece of =mummy_ for, say, _gold_ gold pieces?","Jolly good, %pct. It'll be worth _gold_ gold to you. Now this mummy's tomb is not too far away at all, so it shouldn't take you any longer than =queston_ days to get there, make your grab, and get back. Remember, it's got to be fresh -- preferably off its body. The name of the place is something like ___mondung_. It's sure to be gruesome there. You might want to bring a sword or some such thing.

Oh yes, well, the secret to these boxes is that they are almost impossible to open in any way except by the use of the simple, standard Open spell. %g specifically made them resistant to the fancy alternative spells %g3 friends liked to use.

Q0C20Y02#_questgiver_,random,"Thou art friend to ==questgiver_, this we know. But to help thee, a spell must be woven, a spell that first must destroy before it createth. Wilt thou bring to us a _magicitem_ for our brew, so thou might be blessed by its ruination?","The _magicitem_ we need is held by ==other_. We require it before the day has dawned =1stparton_ times. ==other_ can be found in ___other_. Ask after _other_. Let the gods and spirits guide thy feet, %pcf.","Too employed art thou to do this task, even knowing its importance? Unfortunate for ==questgiver_, and unfortunate for thee, %pcn."
Q0C4XY04#_questgiver_,male,==questgiver_ must once again call on thy kindness and might. We require a heart of a daedra for our spellcraft but the heart must be recently plucked and by thou. Wilt thou find and murder a daedra for your dear aunts?,"The Goddess smiles on us, %pcn, for there is a dungeon near that has a daedric infestation. Any daedra heart will do but that of a Lord, for theirs is putrid with worms. Go thou to ___mondung_, %pcn, slay for us a daedra and bring it before the sun sets =1stparton_ days.","No? Oh, sorrowful night."
R0C10Y00#_questgiver_,random,"If you are available for hire, I need someone reliable to carry out a certain, covert mission. It might be rather time-consuming, but I assure you that you will be suitably compensated. Are you interested?","Very good. I'm giving you an emerald for you to give my contact, _npc1_ of ___npc1_. %g will be waiting in __npc1_. The item needs to be there in =1stparton_ days. That's very important.

I was prepared to be quite generous.
R0C10Y04#_questgiver_,random,The whining peasants who work my land near ___mondung_ have long complained about evil wizardry being practiced in that dungeon. It appears that this time they may be right. I am in need of an assassin with enough time to travel to ___mondung_ and destroy the necromantic sorcerer there. I am prepared to pay _reward_ gold pieces for this service. Are you interested?,"%oth, that's grand. I need to have this wizard extinguished in =1stparton_ days, so you will probably want to get on the road right away. Good luck, %pcf, and show no mercy.",Really? I would have thought this was your sort of an assignment. How inconvenient.
R0C10Y05#_questgiver_,random,"You may be aware that I am forming an alliance with _qgfriend_. To cement our friendship, I have agreed to arrange the death of a consistent threat to %g2 -- some sort of monster. This foul parasite lives in a decrepit old place called ___mondung_. %g has agreed to pay the creature's assassin _reward_ gold in return. Not too bad, I'm sure you'll agree. So, does this sound like your sort of an adventure, %pcn?","Recognize a good deal when you hear it, eh? I told _qgfriend_ that the monster would be dead in =1stparton_ days or %g could go out and hire someone else. So kill the creature and get over to ___qgfriend_ and find %g2 before the time runs out.",Really? How inconsiderate of you to leave me in the lurch like this.
R0C10Y06#_questgiver_,random,"I have a _item_ that's very precious to me. It's been handed down from generation to generation in my family. Knowing this, a small pack of orcish bandits have stolen it and are holding it for ransom. I have no intention of rewarding them for this outrage. On the other hand, I will pay the full amount of the ransom, _reward_ gold pieces to you if you would go to their holdout and steal the _item_ back. Will you?","Good. Now, I am given to understand that the orcs' hideout in in the old ___itemdung_. That's where, I suppose, they're keeping my _item_ as well.

R0C10Y08#_questgiver_,random,"If you could, %pcf, I am in need of assistance from someone I know isn't a complete buffoon. I sent another mercenary out to deliver a small package to a temple, nothing of great value, but damned if it wasn't stolen. Well, at least this idiotic hired hand paid attention to where the bandits went. Do you think you could help me out and get my parcel back?","Thank you in advance, %pcf. Now, the complications. The bandits sold the _item_ to a temple, _itemplace_ in __itemplace_. It apparently has some sort of religious significance to them. In order to avoid embarassment, I need you to steal the _item_ out of the temple and get it to _transporter_. You'll find %g2 at _inn_ in __inn_. The _item_ must be in the moronic _transporter_'s hands within =1stparton_ days; and you must be back here from __inn_ in =2ndparton_ days after that, understand? Not a lot of time. I'm counting on you, %pcf. Good luck and farewell.","%oth, I was afraid you were going to say that. Ah well, I suppose that is better than saying yes and failing."

I have a ... procurer in my employ. Distinctive looking, =spy_ going by the name of _spy_. Well, _spy_'s found a special _item_ of interest to me, but the former owners have %g2 trapped somewhere in __hidingplace_.

R0C10Y15#_questgiver_,random,"I have a somewhat complicated mission that needs a fourth man involved. It might take a couple of days to accomplish, but it will mean an extra _reward_ gold in your pocket.

I am willing to go as high as _reward_ gold. Can I count on your help, %pcf?","Thank you in advance for this, %pcf. What I think would be the best use of your abilities is to infiltrate ___mondung_ and eliminate the so-called shaman of the temple.

Take it to a =npc1_ in a place called __npc1_ in ___npc1_, and there you will get further instructions. Good luck to you, %pcf.","No?

Do not ask any questions -- get this letter to a certain high level sorcerer at the Necromancers' crypt, Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail Mountains. Avoid the rift. If you see it, you have gone too far. They will not be expecting you and will not wait for any introductions. The necromancers feel that death is a reward for the living, not a punishment. Once you have delivered the letter, they would feel no need to guarantee your safety. It is their way.

Lady Brisienna,female,"%pcf, I'm glad you could meet me here. The Blades and your emperor need you again. You may or may not be aware that the Totem of Tiber Septim has been found. For a brief time Lord Woodborne of Wayrest had it. Where he got it from is still a mystery. The Blades mounted an assault upon Woodborne Hall to retrieve it. Although the Hall fell, many of our number fell with it. We sacked the Woodborne Hall, but the Totem was gone. I have reason to believe that Gothryd has the Totem. The Blades no longer have the men to mount an assault on Castle Daggerfall. You have shown yourself to be quite adept at getting in and out of these places. Would go into Castle Daggerfall and retrieve the Totem of Tiber Septim?","I knew I could count on you %pcf. The Totem is most likely in the Daggerfall treasury. It is a huge room, quite unmistakable. I am leaving in a couple of days. I shall send word to you where you can meet me after you get the Totem. Should you succeed, the Emperor has instructed me to gift you with an artifact of great power and renown. _artifact4_!","These are dark times indeed. If Gothryd gets the Mantella as well, Tamriel will be thrown into a civil war."
Princess Elysana,female,"You are even more dashing in person than Lord Woodborne said. I just love talking to men and women of action! I know that you're looking for a certain object, %pcf. A totem pole or something? Well, an acquaintance of mine, a perfectly delightful =contact_, has something that may help you. If you would escort my cousin _foil_ to _contact_ you can have it. Would you do this teensy weensy favor for me?","How exciting! It will be a real adventure. _foil_ just loves to travel and has been dying to spend some time with _contact_. Go to ___contact_ of ____contact_, to a place called __contact_. %g will pay you =reward_ gold pieces for bringing %g2 _foil_. Don't you just love these dangerous missions?",No? How dreadful! My poor cousin will be so disappointed. You are not nearly as fun as Lord Woodborne said you would be.
S0000010#_agentuk_,random,"Good day, %pcf. My name is _agentuk_. I must admit that I am surprised to see you. Are you perhaps able to help the Underking in an endeavor against the Necromancers? We will reward you liberally for this service, and provide information you will probably not be able to find elsewhere.","You will. Hmm. Remarkable. The Necromancers have taken an item of ours, a _reward_ of some value. The value is of secondary concern. The true problem is that they cursed this item and gave it to the Blades. If you are unaware, the Blades were once the honor guard for Tiber Septim. Today they are loyal to the empire and Tiber's code, but not always to the current emperor. The Underking has reason to not wish harm upon the Blades. We want you to infiltrate Castle Llugwych in Ykalon and remove the _reward_. Please have this done in =itemindung_ days if you want your information and reward.",No. I see. Very well.
Queen Barenziah,female,"Thank you for responding to my letter, %pcf. It is very difficult for a queen of a powerful nation, and a queen whose home is far away, to trust any mercenary. That is why when my dear child Helseth told me about you, I was so quick to write. There is a rather sensitive situation brewing, and I need someone I can trust to correct some wayward revolutionaries. For _reward_ gold pieces, will you perform such a service for me? I am also prepared to reward you with information as well as _reward_ gold.","I am glad to hear it. Some years ago, a disgruntled, and possibly deranged, scribe of mine wrote a biography of me which my worst enemy would call cruel and defamatory. Because the book was also excessively critical of the Empire and Septim Imperial family, it was wisely suppressed and its author executed. Unfortunately, chapters of the book resurface from time to time. I have reason to believe one chapter of the book has been purchased by the orcs of Orsinium, who are attempting to publish it. I need it removed from their stronghold, also named Orsinium. Time is of the essence. I'm sure Gortwog will not wait long. Once the chapter is safe, we will talk further about your ambitions.","That is a pity indeed. Prince Helseth is usually correct in his assessment of people, but it would appear that he is wrong in this matter."
Mynisera,female,"Hello %pcn. I have heard much about you. Now you come to me with a very interesting tale of deception. So Cyndassa the maid says that Aubk-i opened a letter from the emperor addressed to me. I can tell you %pcf, that she never delivered such a letter to me. I would like you to investigate this further, %pcn. It could be dangerous to poke into the affairs of Aubk-i without enraging King Gothryd, even though he is my own son. Are you willing?","Good. I have long had my suspicions about Aubk-i's loyalty to the emperor. She is a daughter of the late King Camaron, who ruled Hammerfell from his citadel in Sentinel. My husband King Lysandus, %god rest his soul, died at Cryngaine, as did King Camaron. Lysandus' body was not recovered, so he has a monument erected there rather than a true tomb. Ah...my mind wanders. The emperor uses _messenger_ as his messenger in Daggerfall. %g could be anywhere in the region delivering missives. However, _messenger_ is a member of the Knights of the Dragon. Go to _location_ in __location_ and ask for _dispatcher_. %g may know where to find _messenger_. Try to find out why a letter addressed to me was delivered to Aubk-i.","Aubk-i must have you tightly wound around her finger, %pcn. I hope you survive to benefit from her patronage."
Queen Aubk-i,female,"%pcf, I do not know even how to broach this subject. I need you to promise me on your ancestors' honor that you will do what you can to help me and never breathe of what I say or what you see to anyone else anywhere. Will you so swear?","I will trust you then, %pcf. The matter concerns my mother-in-law, the dowager queen of Daggerfall and widow of Lysandus, Mynisera. As mistress of the household finances, I have noticed that she has been paying for the upkeep of a fortress called ___myndung_ complete with a large platoon of soldiers. A short while ago, she disappeared with a wrapped parcel of papers and came back days later with empty hands. She has recently left again with another parcel of letters and my spies have verified that she has gone to ___myndung_. You will have to trust that my suspicion of her activities is justifiable, for I am not in a position to offer proof. What I need for you to do is go to ___myndung_ and find that parcel of letters or any other information about her activities there. Mynisera will be returning in =2myndung_ days. You cannot have any more time than that, I fear. Good luck.","It would be worse, I suppose, for you to swear and then not be true. Still, I had hoped for more gallantry from you."
Queen Akorithi,female,"%pcn! Welcome to Sentinel. I trust you have had a comfortable stay so far. Let me get right to the point. My son, Prince Lhotun, says you are a well respected and trusted %ra. I have need of your sort. I am willing to pay you _gold_ gold to infiltrate Castle Wayrest and recover an heirloom of the late King Lysandus for me. Will you do it?","What Bounty! There is an item, a painting, that is hidden somewhere within Castle Wayrest. I desire this item for reasons you need not worry about. Bring it to me and I will pay your _gold_ gold.",Hmmm. I shall have to rethink your standing in this court.
Mynisera,female,So Morgiah says Gortwog has the emperor's letter. Very interesting. I think I have a way to get Gortwog to turn over that letter. Are you willing to brave the depths of Orsinium to try to retrieve it?,Gortwog wants very badly to be recognized by the empire. It would mean the beginning of peace between the orcs and the other races of the empire. Present this letter to Gortwog. Hopefully it will persuade him to cooperate.,You are obviously not as loyal to the empire as I thought. Be gone.
King of Worms,male,"%pcf, I am so glad you answered my letter. I hope my messenger was gentle. You have been a loyal servant in the past. Not as loyal as my living dead, but far more versatile. My need involves the lowest depths of Castle Sentinel, and the reward is knowledge that only the dead can provide. Are you willing?","How amusing. I am looking for the answer to a question. It doesn't exist among the living, but may exist among the dead. I want you to bring me back the ghost of Prince Karolis, the great grandfather of the late King Camaron of Sentinel. Karolis was a sorcerer of no mean skill. He is now a lich deep in the bowels of the Castle. I am giving you a special _scarab_. If it is close to him when you destroy his physical body, his soul will be trapped in the _scarab_. Bring it back to me, and I will tell you a tale few mortals have heard.",You must have strong sentiments for Queen Akorithi. What a pity.
T0C00Y00#_qgfriend_,random,"You dare summon forth Azura of the Crimson Gate, pleading for power? I don't know if you are worthy of such favor. In fact, I doubt it very much. I suppose that if I demanded that you murder a priest who has been saying very, very rude things about me, you would refuse even that small, simple request. Would you do that for me?","You would! Oh jolly good. Well, this perfectly awful priest is also a Healer, if that means anything. Isn't that just typical? As usual with these self-righteous types, =monster_ is secluded in ___mondung_, cleansing or some such ridiculous thing. Anyway, why don't you hop on over there and stick a sword in %g2 or something. And then scurry over to ___qgfriend_ and see my dear darling _qgfriend_ who will give you my Star. That's enough power for anyone. I think =1stparton_ days is time enough for this, don't you? Oh, good. Hurry along then, %pcf. And don't be a stranger. Say hi to _qgfriend_ for me. Okay, 'bye.","No! You're supposed to say yes! You're supposed to say: Yes, beautiful Azura, I would gladly murder at the snap of your ivory fingers. Boor! Bigot! Barbarian! Now, I must go before I forget that I am a lady and say something that I'll regret ..."
U0C00Y00#_questgiver_,random,"Power, hah! Would a Mundus-crawling %ra know what to do with real power? You mean you want to be able to bully a few other mortals around, don't you? Well that can be arranged. I want you to show me you have the mettle to actually use what I give you. Will you kill someone for it?","Well, that's a start in the right direction, anyhow. The spellsword I have in mind for you to butcher for power is =monster_, a perfectly charming and charitable ass who's been annoying the hell out me for years. You will find %g2 at %g3 fortress, a place called ___mondung_. Now, don't think that just because =monster_ is a precious toff, %g doesn't know how to fight. I want to make you work a little for this gift. After the murder, go meet _qgfriend_, my agent in ___qgfriend_. Just look for a =qgfriend_ hanging out at __qgfriend_. And don't keep %g2 waiting. I'll tell %g2 you'll be there in =1stparton_ days. That ought to be plenty of time. I'll be watching.","Pah, you make me sick. Don't summon me again, %pcf, unless you grow up or are looking for a fight."
V0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"My needs are rather ... modest, but my offer, I think you will agree, is altruism and generosity indissoluble. In return for _artifact_, an artifact of great power, I only ask that you exterminate a nasty little bit of fur that has been preying on some of my friends who live near ___mondung_. Lupines are generally quite friendly with me and my associates, but this one ... well, kids will be kids. Do we understand one another?","Ah, recognize a good deal, do you? You will find the lupine menace somewhere in a place called ___mondung_. Unfortunately, time is not our friend in this matter. For reasons too dull to discuss, I need the oaf dead in =1stparton_ days. After you have murdered the creature, meet my friend at __contact_ in ___contact_. Just look for a =contact_. Nice doing business with you, %pcn. I'm sure we'll meet again.","Why, you nauseating insect. You poison the air with your thickwitted insolence. How dare you summon forth the greatest of the Princes of Oblivion and refuse the simplest request I could possibly propose? In return for water, I offer you wine and you spit both in my face. I will not forget this, %pcn."
W0C00Y00#_questgiver_,random,"Power, yes, is an allusive but eloquent prosecution. One of my minions possesses an ancient tome called the Oghma Infinium, which bequeaths great power on those who read its pages. If you exterminate a certain scrofulous patrician who has aroused my displeasure, I will arrange a meeting between you and the book. Is this agreeable?","Very well. This socialite I referred to resides at the palace of __palace_. For the record, the name of your quarry is _enemy_. Kill %g2 and proceed to ___contact_, where my servant _contact_ will wait for you in a library. I do not think there is anything to be gained by continuing this interview. Fail me not in this, %pcf, and the power thou craves will be thine.","You answer negatively. Am I to understand that you sought power, but seek it for free? You ought to have sought wisdom instead, for that is what you need. I bid you a very disappointed goodbye."
X0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"If you would not mind doing a small favor for me, I can put in your possession a most excellent reward, _artifact_. I have a child, apparently miserable with all the blessings I have given him, who needs ... what is the euphemism? To be taught a lesson? A very serious lesson. Does this sound like an agreeable contract, %pct?","Ah, good. This child of mine is a wereboar who has made his den in a place called ___mondung_. You should have no trouble finding it. After you have put him out of his obvious misery, which should not take more than =1stparton_ days, go to a place called __contact_ in ___contact_ and look for a person named _contact_. If you arrive there within =1stparton_ days from now with the wereboar dead, %g will give you _artifact_. A pleasure doing business with you, %pct. Good luck and farewell.","I am gravely disappointed, %pct. // Seldom am I summoned, even rarer are the occasions when I am free to answer a summoning. To be perfectly blunt, this was a waste of my very precious time."
Y0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"So you want power? Yes, many covet power, yes, but so few know why. Want you _artifact_? Is very special, _artifact_. Very nice, yes yes. Just, do one thing, and you have it, mmmm. Child have I that needs to be punished, yes. You will do this for lovely, lovely _artifact_, yes?","Mmm, Mortalcreature brave, good good. Now, go to ___mondung_, kill frost daedra there. It thinks safe, ha, we slaughter frostflesh tight and everywhere. You kill it and go =contact_, %g2 _contact_ in __tavern_. Got good good _artifact_ for you. Kill frost daedra and see _contact_ before =1stparton_ Mundal nights. Go now, %pcn. Dagon waits.","Scruh! Mortalcreature say no to Mehrunes Dagon! Mortalcreature know you time means nothing to Dagon, he remembers insult, yes. Hamita too black for Mortalcreature, no, I ... will ... remember %pcn."
