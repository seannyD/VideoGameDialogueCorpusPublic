../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Anti-Hero,0," [Anti-Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero): Depending on play style, the Nerevarine can be the very dark gray in a [Black-and-Gray Morality](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality) situation, with Dagoth Ur as the ""black."" You can become a vampire/werewolf, own slaves, murder indiscriminately, practice necromancy, join factions of [Evil Sorcerers](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer)/[Assassins](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc)/[Thieves](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild), and even become an [Omnicidal Neutral](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalNeutral). The situation is such that if Dagoth Ur succeeds, you won't be able to continue those morally questionable ways, so you'll need to stop him. Can cross over into [Villain Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist) territory if you really go out of your way to be malevolent.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Amnesiac Hero,0," [Amnesiac Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero): In a very roundabout way, the Nerevarine is this. As the reincarnation of Indoril Nerevar, they do not have the memories from their past life, and much of the main story is the Nerevarine finding fragments of their lost past. This is especially after they are recognized as Nerevar, with many characters seeing Nerevar and the Nerevarine as the same person.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,The Archmage,0, [The Archmage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage): It's very much possible to achieve maximum level in all magical skills; plus you can be named Archmage in Mages Guild.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Asskicking Leads to Leadership,0, [Asskicking Leads to Leadership](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingLeadsToLeadership): Pretty much how you end up at the top of any of the guilds or factions. Especially true for the ones where you have to kill the previous guildmaster in battle.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingLeadsToLeadership
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,The Chosen One,1," [The Chosen One](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne): Zig-zagged. The game presents multiple conflicting interpretations of the protagonist's relationship to [The Prophecy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProphecy), and leaves it deliberately ambiguous whether this trope is in effect or not:<ul>
-   The simplest explanation is that it's played straight — you are the divine reincarnation of the Hero-King Nerevar, fulfilling your prophesied destiny by destroying Dagoth Ur and avenging yourself upon the false gods of the Tribunal who betrayed you in your past life. This is supported by the fact that the Emperor's [prophetic dreams](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome) singled you out as the one who would fulfill the prophecy; Dagoth Ur recognizing you as the reincarnation of Nerevar, before you have completed any part of the prophecy besides being born; the Moon and Star Ring not killing you when you wear it; Azura stating you are Nerevar reborn; and Almalexia (Nerevar's wife) referring to you as Nerevarine.
-   The second possibility is that it's subverted — you're just an extraordinarily [lucky](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky) / [determined](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator) mortal of no real importance who, [by sheer coincidence](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne), winds up perfectly fitting the prophesied description of Nerevar's reincarnation through comparatively mundane means. This is supported by the presence of numerous ""failed Nerevarines"" in the Cavern of the Incarnate, and the fact that secret paths allow you to skip certain parts of the prophecy (albeit with great difficulty). Several dialogue choices allow you to play into this interpretation, and depict yourself as an Nerevarine who is trying to fulfil the prophecy of their volition because they think it is the right thing to do, not [Because Destiny Says So](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo).
-   The third interpretation is a mix of the two — that the prophecy is more of a guide to becoming the Nerevarine, rather than a proper foretelling of future events, and by successfully meeting its requirements you *become* Nerevar's reincarnation. This fits with the concept of ""mantling"" established in other games, whereby a mortal can in essence ""become"" a pre-existing divine entity by thoroughly emulating them. <sup>For example...</sup>  One common interpretation of Tiber Septim's ascension to godhood as ""Talos"" is that he mantled the creator-god Lorkhan (patron deity of humanity), and in the *Oblivion* DLC *The Shivering Isles*, the player character frees the Daedric Prince Jyggalag from the curse that transformed him into Sheogorath by mantling Sheogorath and taking his place as the Prince of Madness. </ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Cursed with Awesome,0," [Cursed with Awesome](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome): At a certain point in the main quest, you'll be afflicted with the Corprus Disease. The disease leaves sufferers as [The Ageless](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless) with [Ideal Illness Immunity](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealIllnessImmunity), but also serves them with a nasty case of [Body Horror](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror) and a severe loss of mental faculties. Eventually, you'll be ""cured"" of the disease, but only the negative parts.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Deadpan Snarker,0," [Deadpan Snarker](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker): In the Journal, your character will make some pithy comments on occasion. Perhaps the best example is if you are a member of [Great House Telvanni](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy) and are on the quest to be named Telvanni Hortator. As House Telvanni actively practices [Klingon Promotion](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion) and believes in [Might Makes Right](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight), you can simply kill all of the other Councilors rather than grovel for their votes. The Journal entry for completion of the quest dryly puts it: ""As the sole surviving councilor of House Telvanni, I have declared myself Hortator of House Telvanni.""",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Duel to the Death,0, [Duel to the Death](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath): Can get in to 4 of these in the Vivec arena (with a few others optional) either during the quest to be named Nerevarine/Hortator or during the process of rising to the top of each guild and faction.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath

../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Extreme Omnisexual,0," [Extreme Omnisexual](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual): Though you don't get to see what your character actually says, the NPC responses to the ""Admire"" dialogue choice are frequently responses to pick-up lines or come-ons. This happens regardless of their race or gender.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual

../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Fungus Humongous,0," [Fungus Humongous](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FungusHumongous): Playing as a member of House Telvanni will eventually allow the Nerevarine to construct their own mushroom tower, Tel Uvirith, in the heart of Vvardenfell. Non-Telvanni players are sent there to kill a Telvanni councilor, and the player can claim it for themselves if they want.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FungusHumongous
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Going Native,0," [Going Native](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative): Joining a Great House — even the most Imperialized House, Hlaalu, is still at core a Dunmer house based on Dunmer traditions — and just looking out for the interests of Morrowind's people first (prominently mentioned when  (SPOILER)  Caius Cosades is recalled , leaving you the highest ranking Blade in the area) is heavily encouraged. It's entirely possible to go full-blown, avoid all the non-Blade Imperial factions, and join just a Great House and the Temple (unless you go native in the Telvanni — their traditions discourage giving more than the absolute minimum of tolerance to the Tribunal).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Guile Hero,0," [Guile Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero): The original Nerevar was one of these, and to complete much of the game, the player will have to be the same.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,I Am Who?,0," [I Am Who?](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWho): The Nerevarine, Lord Nerevar [reborn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation). Prophesied hero who will defeat Dagoth Ur and cast down the ""False Gods"" of the Tribunal. (Or you are, at least, if you don't dig too deeply into Azura's motivations and manipulations...)

../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,The Hero,0," [The Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero): Exactly which flavor depends on how you choose to play, ranging from a goody-two-shoes [All-Loving Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero) to a near [Villain Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Ideal Illness Immunity,0," [Ideal Illness Immunity](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealIllnessImmunity): A side effect of the Corprus Disease.  (SPOILER)  After having the negative effects cured, this is one of the positive effects the Nerevarine gets to keep. ",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealIllnessImmunity
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,I Have Many Names,0," [I Have Many Names](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames): In addition to the Nerevarine and several variants (Nerevar Incarnate, the Incarnate, the Nerevarine Incarnate — and Nerevarine 'of Four Tribes' in a certain prophetic context), one will pick up the titles of Hortator of the Great Houses, Operative of the Blades, and Hearthfriend of the Ashlanders. And those merely come from completing the main quest. Add in titles from the various Guilds and Factions, as well as some more from the expansions, and it's possible to come away with over a dozen titles.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,"Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane",0," [Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane): So, are you the real deal Nerevarine—reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer [Folk Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero)—or a particularly clever and lucky impostor who tricked everyone with the help of [The Empire](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) *and* a Daedric Prince? The game never answers it definitively (it even throws in the third possibility of you *[becoming](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask)* the reincarnation of Nerevar by doing what the reincarnation is meant to do), and the most knowledgeable (sane) beings in the setting prefer not to jump to any conclusions about you.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Multi-Melee Master,0," [Multi-Melee Master](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster): It's a simple matter, in the long run, to significantly level and master multiple weapon classes. Even if you only stick to one weapon skill, every category encompasses multiple types of weapon, each of which scale with the same skill and stats but vary in playstyle. For instance, proficiency in blunt weapons allows you to wield huge warhammers, simple clubs and magical rods with equal skill, while long blades range from common swords to katana to greatswords.<ul>
-   Long Blade encompasses [one-handed swords](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords), [sabers](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScimitar) and [katana](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter), as well as [two-handed daikatana and claymores](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS).
-   Short Blade covers shortswords, wakizashi, daggers, and tanto.
-   The Axe skill concerns both one-handed war axes and two-handed battle axes.
-   The Spear skill is for both spears and halberds.
-   Blunt Weapon covers the broadest range, with [clubs](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryABigStick), staves, maces and warhammers.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,"One Riot, One Ranger",0," [One Riot, One Ranger](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneRiotOneRanger): In order to fulfill the Nerevarine Prophesy, you need to be named the ""Hortator"" of the three Dunmeri Great Houses with holdings on Vvardenfell. A Hortator is a traditional Dunmer war-leader, implied to typically lead entire *armies* into battle. However, circumstances are such here that you will need to go into Red Mountain to face Dagoth Ur on your own.  (SPOILER)  Primarily, this is because you have been rendered immune to all disease (another requirement to meet the prophecy) while anyone you could bring along would risk catching a Blight disease, or worse, the Corprus Disease.

../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Parental Abandonment,0," [Parental Abandonment](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment): Is an orphan. This is actually a requirement of the Nerevarine prophesy:

By the end of the game, you're one of the most powerful beings in Vvardenfell, if not on all of Tamriel, and have  (SPOILER)  slain 2-3 full blown Physical Gods, as well as the aspect of another, more powerful god-like being.  You also still have the Corprus disease, with the negative effects cured, leaving you as [The Ageless](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless) and immune to all other disease. Corprus disease is alternatively known as ""the Divine Disease,"" and was created by Dagoth Ur using the power of the Heart of Lorkhan, the [dead creator god](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead) of the Elder Scrolls universe. You keep this even after  (SPOILER)  you destroy the heart , meaning you still have a connection to its divinity. It may not be as strong of connection as the Tribunal or Dagoth Ur, but it is a shred of the divine.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Protagonist Without a Past,0," [Protagonist Without a Past](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistWithoutAPast): A few details of the Nerevarine's backstory are established in the storyline: the Nerevarine was a prisoner, he or she was sent from the Imperial City's prison to Morrowind, there was something special about his or her day of birth (""born on a certain day""), and his or her parents are unknown. A Dunmer Nerevarine wasn't born in Morrowind, either, which still makes him/her to be qualified since the lost prophecies state that the Nerevarine would be an outlander.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistWithoutAPast
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Rags to Riches,0," [Rags to Riches](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches): You start off as a penniless prisoner fresh off the boat with nothing more than the clothes on your back. By the end of the game, you'll very likely have more gold than you could ever spend, a vast collection of legendary artifacts and a mansion stronghold to store it all in. With all of the [Money for Nothing](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing) available, this process will usually only take a couple of in-game months.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches
../data/ElderScrolls/Morrowind/,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,The Nerevarine,The Nerevarine,Reincarnation,0," [Reincarnation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation): Of Nerevar... *maybe*. You do fit the traits laid out in the Nerevarine Prophesy (but [so did many others before you](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoiceChosen)), you're capable of wearing the Moon-and-Star ring (which is designed to kill anyone who isn't Nerevar), and Dagoth Ur calls you ""Nerevar, my old friend"". But it is strongly implied that you might just be a convenient [Unwitting Pawn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn) for Azura to get her revenge on the Tribunal for defying her thousands of years ago. Further, thanks to the *Elder Scrolls* series' act of ""[Mantling<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mantling)"", you most likely *become* the Nerevarine by the end of the game. Mantling makes it possible to become one with another person or deity by, essentially, tricking the universe into thinking that you're that being, generally by filling their role closely enough. By undergoing the same trials and tribulations that the Nerevarine is supposed to do, you've filled his role and have become him.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation

There are definite indications that the Nerevarine is still alive-and-kicking by the time of *Skyrim*, over 200 years later. Of course, since there's [no ""canon"" name or race or gender](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessProtagonist) for the Nerevarine, a few third-hand accounts are about all the writers could plausibly include to say so.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld

The ""stripes"" part comes in with the fact that technically the Blades are a knightly order <sup>note </sup>  though in *Morrowind* that meant knight as an honorific and title rather than as an armored mounted warrior  and by then-available information descended from an elite military unit.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes
