Similarly, whoever wins at the end of the Civil War questline will imply that they expect to call on you in the future, since a second war with the Thalmor seems to be all but inevitable.
-   The end of *Dragonborn* adds another plot hook into the mix,  (SPOILER) as Hermaeus Mora declares you will replace [Miraak](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream) as his [right-hand man](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleTopEnforcer), despite any objections you might have in the matter. </ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues

See [Face–Heel Turn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn) if you do the opposite.
-   The game itself will invoke this trope with you. If you steal from your fellows in the Thieves' Guild or kill a colleague in the Dark Brotherhood, you must make restitution (though the latter is a subversion as a fine of 500 gold is all that is assessed for murder). You can also pay off your bounties for crimes committed in various communities. If your skill in Illusion is high enough to pacify a guard long enough to accept the bounty, you can make restitution for any and all crimes.
-   Smaller sidequests occasionally allow you to do a favor for someone you wronged in another quest. For example, you can beat up the bartender at the Bee and the Barb in Riften as part of a racketeering job for the Thieves' Guild, then retrieve the gemstones her lover needs to prepare a wedding band so he can propose to her.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner

-    (SPOILER) The *Dragonborn* DLC confirms that you are the *Last* and must deal with the return of the *First*. 
-   The Dragonborn is also the chosen one of every *other* circumstance and guild they run across. Whether it's restoring ancient guilds to power, ending a civil war, averting a vampire apocalypse, or a random alchemist needs to find a magical phial. The Dragonborn's presence changes everything.

-   Playing any race other than Nord tends to lead to this, but Khajiit, Argonian, Altmer, and Dunmer Dragonborn in particular will still get talked down to by guards and some  NPCs , even after defeating Alduin.
-   The Blades, despite supposedly being sworn to *serve* the Dragonborn, often treat them as an indentured servant and *demand* they perform tasks for them.
-   Due to ambient dialogue being randomized, guards will often mock and talk down to you regardless of your titles and status, such as ""So you can cast a few spells, am I supposed to be impressed?"" even if you're the  (SPOILER) Archmage of the College , and ""Now I remember, you're that new member of the Companions... so, you do what?

(SPOILER) Subverted later on when he becomes grudgingly respectful of the Dragonborn once they claim the Staff of Magnus, recovers the *Oghma Infinium* and the Black Books, defeats Miraak and earns the patronage of Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora, and if the Dragonborn has done enough favours for him to be recognized as a member of House Telvanni. </ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect

The Stormcloaks and Empire will also give you titles that effectively serve as your name while working for them, and once you become the leader of some of the various factions, most members of that faction will address you by your title there.

You do need to cast a couple spells during the questline, but they are all quite basic and some can be replicated with staves. The mages don't seem to care whether you're using magical or mundane ways of carving a bloody path through their enemies. Then again, you do wield an ancient form of magic only known by about five other people in all of Skyrim, and indeed one of the ways to gain entry to the College is to tell Faralda that you're Dragonborn and prove it by Shouting at her.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage

-   People won't be gushing over you, but you'll occasionally hear some  NPC  banter that paints you as good-looking regardless of your appearance, even if you're non-human, covered in dirt, brutally scarred, partially blind, and clad in dragon bones. Then again, given that Skyrim is a land of [Blood Knights](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight), these might well be sexy traits as far as the locals are concerned.
-   Some very complimentary examples from Narri of Falkreath:
QUOTE **To a male Dragonborn:** Shor's bones, a handsome man in Falkreath!<br data-format=""\\""/>**To a female Dragonborn:** You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.

-   Put on the Amulet of Mara, which indicates that you're interested in getting married, and listen to assorted  NPCs  comment about how someone like *you* should already have been snapped up. Then again, you *are* the Dragonborn, and potentially have quite a long list of other respectable <sup>note </sup>  (or not-so-respectable but still quite lofty)  titles as well.
-   In Riverwood, Alvor the Blacksmith's wife might mention to a female Dragonborn that she's very pretty... and to stay away from her husband.

../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,characters,characters,Instant Expert,0," [Instant Expert](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert): Happens in three ways:<ul>
-   The first way is what effectively makes the Dragonborn so special. Instead of having to spend years on mastering the Thu'um, you can simply absorb a dragon's soul and use those to master a known word of power. This does have its limits; the Dragonborn does not absorb a full understanding of the Dragon Language itself, something Alduin mocks you about at one point. Similarly, Arngeir only realises this when you tell him that you had no clue what any of the Greybeards actually were saying during your initiation ceremony.
-   The second way is with the skills themselves: If you read enough skill books and possess enough money to buy training sessions, you can easily go from being a complete novice in a skill to being fairly passable in it in the course of an in-game afternoon. It's also funny when one considers the perk system; if, for example, the Dragonborn decides to take the Dragon Smithing perk, they instantly know how to forge armors from dragon scales and bones, despite the fact that *no one in Tamriel* knows how to do this (given that until very recently, there *were* no dragons around!). Though in that case it probably just means that you’re good enough at smithing to invent the armor yourself.
-   The perk tree works in a way such that you can save all of your perks and use them when you deem the skill necessary. This can result in a novice who barely knows how to aim with a bow at a deer becoming a master huntsman who can land a killshot on a elite Thalmor Justicar from several miles away.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert
../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,characters,characters,Interspecies Romance,0," [Interspecies Romance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance): Possible for any Dragonborn.

That said, guess who is one of the very first Imperials you can kill as soon as you enter Helgen Keep? And, for bonus points, the first weapon you can get your hands on is an axe.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony
../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,characters,characters,Jumping Off the Slippery Slope,0," [Jumping Off the Slippery Slope](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope): The Dark Brotherhood questline invokes this on your character. While your dialogue options choose how they respond to the quests to kill people, the early victims you're sent against are varying shades of unpleasant jerks who have done something to deserve their fate, with the exception of one victim who may be a [Mercy Kill](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill) for how miserable his life has become. However, as the questline continues, your victims become less and less deserving, and by the time you're into the end of the questline you're killing perfectly good and innocent people who do not even have contracts on them, but killing them gets you closer to the *actual* target of the contract.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope

The only possible forms of comeuppance you can receive are sub-optimal quest results, making various enemies, and the occasional Game Over.
-   In a more in-universe case, the Dragonborn can potentially make promises to the various Daedric Princes, meaning that in death they would serve them in some way, and yet they won't live up to his end of the bargain in the end. For instance, as the Champion of Nocturnal, they would guard over the Twilight Sepulcher for some years, or as a Champion of Hircine, they would spend eternity in Hircine's hunting grounds. However, because they are Dragonborn, their soul belongs to Akatosh before all others. Even if soul trapped and not a Nord, the Dragonborn's final reward will always be Sovngarde, no matter who believes they have a claim on the Dragonborn's soul.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini

Interestingly, while hot property is limited to designated fences for proper sale, there's nothing stopping you from *gifting* hot property for miscellaneous ""I'd love it if you could find me one of those"" quests.<ul>
-   The Dragonborn's background also makes your kleptomaniac tendencies a [Justified Trope](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope). You are a Dragonborn, you see, a mortal born with the soul of a dragon. Paarthurnax explains that this not only grants you access to the dragons' [Thu'um](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout), but it also makes you prone to draconic personality flaws, like wanting to [fight over anything](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper) and being driven to dominate - and, apparently, also kinda making you want to gather your own [Dragon Hoard](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonHoard). In this case, it could be said all gamers are Dragonborn: [killing every monster you come across](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEverythingThatMoves), [completing every quest you come across](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou) (including and especially ones that will give you perks like land ownership in return), and taking all the stuff [you come across](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree) are practically ingrained in gamer culture from the time one can first hold a controller.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero

-   In a metaphorical sense, since the Dragonborn are said to have been created by Akatosh and you are the last one in the line, the Dragonborn could be considered the *lastborn* offspring of Akatosh, as opposed to Alduin who is the *firstborn*.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind

Fully perked, the werewolf sprint attack maxes out at 960 damages at level 46—which is several times stronger than a hit from maxed Legendary daedric warhammer without fortify restoration abuse. If you have *Dawnguard*, the werewolf form also has a pretty respectable scaled armor rating that maxes out at 400 and when combined with some passive magic resistance could practically make you impervious to damages. One combination that absolutely qualifies for this trope, however, is the Elemental Fury shout combined with the orc racial power, [berserker rage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage). Elemental Fury increases your attack speed, doubling it at max power, while berserker rage doubles your attack damage while cutting the damage you take in half.

-   Should the Dragonborn decide to focus solely on magic, smithing and enchanting, they can end up as a Mage decked out in heavily enchanted armour that reduces the magicka cost to nearly zero, allowing them to constantly fling fireballs at their enemies.

-   The Dragonborn's path is full of hundreds of enemies, including wild animals, giants, bandits, golems, undead, Thalmor, and, of course, dragons. And none of them will survive the encounter. At higher levels it is entirely possible for a player to enter a room with half a dozen enemies and casually take them all out with one attack, or even all out at once with a Thu'um or other spell. And several quests have people sending you out to forts and caves and tombs to liberate them from bandits or undead, and you'll do it with ease. This is seen most prominently in the Civil War quests, in which one quest to liberate a fort from the enemy gives you the option to to barge in alone instead of a more conventional ambush tactic.
QUOTE **Dragonborn:** I have a better plan. You wait here, and I'll take care of it.

-   Also of note, the song ""Dragonborn"" contains choice lyrics like ""And the tale, boldly told, of the one / Who was kin to both wyrm and the races of man / With a power to rival the sun"" and ""Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all / As the Dragonborn issued his roar!""</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy

-   Given that you really can't ally with the Thalmor without mods, you're pretty much guaranteed to be foiling their plans left and right, potentially with little to no knowledge that you're doing so.<ul>
-   They started a costly civil war to keep the Empire in turmoil and unable to consolidate its power in time for the inevitable second war between them. If you don't discover the dossier revealing their role, you either reunify the Empire, thus giving the Empire an opportunity to reconsolidate its own power and prepare for this war, or you unify Skyrim in the name of a bunch of proud warriors who have some serious beef with the Thalmor.
-   They are attempting to hunt down Talos worshipers by catching them in the act. Should you place Torygg's war horn on the Altar of Talos, you will probably kill a couple of Thalmor Inquisitors who try to kill you for doing so. You do find plans on their corpses, though.
-   They have captured one of the sons of the Gray-Mane family an are torturing him for information. You break in and free him because you're friends with that family. You might even unintentionally make this easier if you found Northwatch Keep early on before starting ""Missing In Action"" and killed all the Thalmor guards there for whatever reason, leaving only a small group of soldiers remaining inside.
-   And all of this is not even considering the possibility that you could simply kill a bunch of Thalmor agents on the road for no particular reason, or to take their things. And while you can't get into the Embassy grounds normally, it's possible to just break into the outer barracks of the Embassy and kill and loot the guards inside. Further, if you've won the Civil War or finished Season Unending, its possible to *kill Elenwen* [if you can get inside her building somehow.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight)</ul>
-   In the Dark Brotherhood, you upend Astrid's plans to be the ""family don"" simply by stumbling into the Night Mother's crypt when attempting to spy on Cicero. Alternately, you upend the entire guild's plans to  (SPOILER) keep existing by killing Astrid instead of one of her chosen targets during your recruitment, then following Commander Maro's instructions to wipe out the rest of them .
-   In the Thieves' Guild, you thwart Karliah's plan to kill Mercer by walking into the ambush room first. Karliah shoots you instead. However, as this particular chain of events is the [Wham Episode](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode) of this questline that makes her your ally and Mercer your enemy, she uses this setback to turn right back around and orchestrate Mercer's death. Basically, by being a spanner in the works for Karliah, you become a spanner in the works for Mercer.
-   You can also potentially infuriate an NPC without even knowing you did it, leading them to send the Dark Brotherhood after you (even if you're the Listener).
-   You are also indirectly responsible for the civil war continuing. You just happened to be caught sneaking into Skyrim and were set to be executed alongside Ulfric Stormcloak, but because you're the last Dragonborn, Alduin came after you as soon as he was free from being stuck outside of time. He interrupts your execution and sets to destroying everything he sees, destroying Helgen and causing a distraction that allows Ulfric to flee to freedom and to continue the war.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks

Indeed, many times you'll see dragons flying around that are not hostile unless you engage them, as a dragon's pride is at stake when it comes to fighting a Dragonborn. Special mention for the trope goes to Durnehviir in the *Dawnguard* expansion, who yearns to return to Tamriel but has spent so many centuries in the Soul Cairn that he can no longer separate himself from it and only has the brief moments granted by using a Shout to summon him into Tamriel; as well as Numinex, the dragon famously trapped in Dragonsreach, the palace in Whiterun, by the ancient king Olaf One-eye.

-   If questioned about their neutrality, Arngeir will explain that Jurgen Windcaller, the original founder of their order, suffered a terrible defeat in battle despite his mastery of the Thu'um. Upon meditating on why this happened, he came to the conclusion that he had misused the power of the Thu'um, which should only be used to glorify and honor the Nordic gods. The Greybeards follow his ""Way of the Voice"" philosophy to distance themselves from the rest of the world in meditative seclusion.
-   In addition, contrary to what Delphine claims, Arngeir implicitly encourages the Dovahkiin to act against Alduin; his logic is that the Way of the Voice applies to the Greybeards, because their power was granted by Kynareth and they have *chosen* to undergo intense study to refine it. The Dovahkiin, on the other hand, was made by *Akatosh* and was likely made for a specific duty which they must fulfill. Arngeir suggests that rather than follow their teachings, as long as the Dragonborn uses the Voice for selfless reasons and to honor the Gods, they will remain true to the Way.
-   The [Level Cap](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap), before patch 1.9, was 81; this was the level at which one would fight the Ebony Warrior.

The Blades, on the other hand (or at least Delphine), consider the Greybeards to be cowards afraid of their own power; they are convinced that it would be better if the Greybeards put that power to use making a difference in the world, rather than living in seclusion and never using it. Their treatment of the Dragonborn also drastically contrasts; the Greybeards offer council when asked but leave the Dragonborn to their own devices to pursue their destiny as they see fit, while the Blades steer the Dragonborn in the direction they believe is best and withdraw their help if the Dragonborn refuses to listen to them.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil

The Imperials are frustrated with the Nords, due to their adherence to their own traditions being a major cause of the civil war (namely, Ulfric challenging and killing Torygg giving him a perfectly valid claim to be High King under Nord tradition), while the Nords claim the Empire doesn't understand or respect how proud they are of their long heritage. Conversations between Tullius and Rikke highlight both sides of this; Rikke emphasizes to Tullius that the Nords are very proud of their traditions and don't always follow their heads if they go against them, to which Tullius often mutters that such behavior is ridiculous and the cause of the trouble.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing

Even the Thalmor are just a very, very dark gray, as their ultimate goal is something other elven races probably wouldn't mind (namely, ""Escape from the prison that is the Mundus""), *if* they weren't being such genocidal pricks in their campaign to achieve that goal (IE: ""Destroy the prison and everyone who doesn't agree with us that it *is* a prison"").
-   And as for the Jarls, many of their positions are not cut and dry. Both sides have a [Token Evil Teammate](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate) with the Silver-Bloods of Markarth and the Black-Briars of Riften, and both sides have their share of noble rulers and upper-class idiots among the Jarls and their council.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality

-   The Stormcloaks despise the Imperial-leaning Nords for ""abandoning"" their traditional Nord beliefs in favor of the Imperial pantheon, despite the fact that many Nords worship Imperial aspects of the Divines like Akatosh  <sup>note </sup>  made even worse since [Akatosh was hated by the ancient Nords<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/shezarr-and-divines), giving no heed to their old religion. 
-   The Imperials protest that the Empire *had* to sign the White-Gold Concordat to protect the Imperial way of life or be wiped out. During Vittoria Vici's wedding, when Vulwuf Snow-Shod confronts the Emperor's aunt with the idea that the Stormcloaks are finding themselves in the exact same position with the banning of Talos worship damaging their culture, she has no counter.
-   The Markarth Incident is basically a microcosm of the larger Civil War; the Forsworn, a group that has been historically marginalized by outsiders and are seen as barbaric savages (not to mention having a different religion from them), rebels against the Jarl of the Reach and takes control of it. They attempt to declare the Reach an independent kingdom, but they're brutally crushed. The catch here is the one who led the army that beat the Forsworn was Ulfric.

-   The Empire and Stormcloaks both want to return to Talos worship and end the civil war to prepare for an inevitable second war with the Thalmor, and Tullius and Ulfric are both crusty, battle-hardened military leaders. Eavesdropping on their conversations with Rikke / Galmar often reveals very similar conversations taking place, *especially* during ""Season Unending"" where the two sides try to negotiate a truce. For example, when the player overhears them discussing the Jagged Crown as a symbol of legitimacy to the throne:
QUOTE **Ulfric:** Tell me again why we're wasting time and dwindling resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!<br data-format=""\\""/>**Galmar:** The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Ulfric:** Damn the Jarls. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Galmar:** They demand the Moot. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Ulfric:** And damn the Moot! We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Torygg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Galmar:** All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Ulfric:** A crown doesn't make a king. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Galmar:** No, but this one...<br data-format=""\\\""/>
**Tullius:** Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Rikke:** If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Tullius:** Don't you Nords put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king. We're backing Elisif. When the Moot meets, they'll do the sensible thing. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Rikke:** Not everyone's agreed to the Moot. You've been here long enough to know that Nords aren't always sensible. We follow our hearts. <br data-format=""\\""/>**Tullius:** So what - Ulfric gets this crown and then suddenly he's High King? <br data-format=""\\""/>**Rikke:** No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around. But, if we found it first... <br data-format=""\\""/>**Tullius:** And if we gave it to Elisif? <br data-format=""\\""/>**Rikke:** In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.

-   Amusingly, both Ulfric and Tullius can be caught using similar terminologies during the negotiations, once again showing similar minds and thoughts. Under different circumstances, these men might have been friends.
-   On a more poignant note,  (SPOILER) Ulfric and Galmar or Rikke can be met again in Sovngarde if the Civil War is resolved one way or the other before you go there. Apparently the Nord afterlife doesn't take sides and views them all as equally worthy of being there. 
-   To underline this, the game contains two songs, ""The Age of Oppression"" and ""The Age of Aggression"". One is pro-Stormcloak denouncing the Empire and championing Ulfric as the true High King, while the other is pro-Empire denouncing the Stormcloaks and declaring Ulfric as a king-killer. And both songs have exactly the same melody and very similar lyrics. A book discussing the two songs in-game speculates one song was likely adapted from the other, but no one knows which was written first.
-   Both factions also have mirror counterparts in the Jarls that have aligned with them. Idgrod and Korir are Jarls of small holds who are reasonable but have issues that harm their reputation (Ravencrone's eccentricity and visions, Korir's absolute hatred for the one thing that puts his hold on the map, the College); Siddgeir and Skald the Elder are ineffective [man children](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild); Igmund and Laila Law-Giver are puppet rulers who have no real control over their holds thanks to criminal families (Thongvor and Maven, who will replace said Jarls if their faction loses the Civil War); a [Reasonable Authority Figure](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure) in the form of Brina and Dengeir; a nondescript [Nice Guy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy) in Kraldar and Sorli the Builder.

../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,All Participants,All Participants,Soldier vs. Warrior,0," [Soldier vs. Warrior](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVSWarrior): When it comes to their doctrines, the Imperials (Soldier) and the Stormcloaks (Warrior) are as different as chalk and cheese:<ul>
-   Imperial Legion soldiers use standardised Imperial equipment - a short steel sword fashioned in the Imperial style, a shield, a bow and arrows and a set of leather or studded leather armour. Stormcloaks have a lot more variety in equipment, some chainmail and padded armour, and likely whatever weapon the warrior in question prefers or can afford - swords, axes and maces in both one and two-handed varieties, iron and steel.
-   Training varies differently, as does troop quality. Most Imperial soldiers appear to be largely Imperials from Cyrodiil or local Nords from the civilized western half of Skyrim, relatively green but drilled every day to ensure they stay in peak fitness and fighting condition by experienced officers. By contrast Stormcloak training relies mainly on the [harshness of eastern Skyrim itself](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp); many of the older Stormcloaks are former Legion soldiers and veterans of the Great War and / or the Markarth Incident. A traditional Nord rite of passage adopted by the Stormcloaks as an initiation involves swimming across freezing sea to an iceberg and then killing an ice wraith in single combat.
-   The Imperial Legion is a strict military hierarchy arranged in rank from the lowly Auxiliary to the high General, and soldiers are expected to always act professionally and in accordance with the same laws they enforce, as they are the face of the Empire to most of its citizens. Stormcloaks are loosely banded together as ""shield-brothers / sisters"" with little to unite them beyond belief in Ulfric and the cause he champions; the only authority they recognize is [authority gained through asskicking](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingLeadsToLeadership), mostly acting on their own initiative but deferring to a more seasoned warrior when necessary.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVSWarrior

-   The Age of Aggression, a pro-Imperial song, is sung in Whiterun Hold. This song is not present in Stormcloak territories.

Even though Elisif and Tullius are Ulfric's official foes, Balgruuf plays a much larger role in the story itself and is repeatedly presented as a counterpart to the latter. Balgruuf admires the Greybeards and probably wishes he could have studied under them like Ulfric did, but was instead stuck leading an ""ordinary"" Nord life, while Ulfric by contrast was raised from boyhood as a Greybeard, but instead chose to abandon that path in order to pursue the ""ordinary"" Nord life. Apart from this and their different stance on the civil war, they are remarkably alike; they are each respected Jarls of a major hold with a lot of experience as both warriors and rulers, and they are both descended from some of Skyrim's oldest known families.

Naturally, the Stormcloaks lay siege to it in a bid push the Imperials back to Solitude; if you're aligned with them, you're part of the force tasked with breaching the walls and fighting through the city to the Cloud District.

-   He readily accepts that the dragons have returned after hearing several firsthand accounts, moves to protect his people immediately, enlists the aid of the one person he knows with the most experience with dragons (you, by virtue of having survived Helgen), and instantly acknowledges the status and importance of the Dovahkiin. During the ""Diplomatic Immunity"" quest, the Dragonborn can ask him to provide a distraction, and he readily agrees even though he doesn't know exactly what you're doing — but he feels he can trust you.
-   Other Jarls will ask you to do some sort of errand and/or to have a certain level of status in their Hold before making you a Thane. Balgruuf? You just killed a dragon terrorizing his Hold; that's plenty enough to deserve the honor.
-   He's also aware that there are other threats besides bandits, dragons, and the Civil War. (For a dash of savvy in these quotes, one of the members of the Companions is Vignar Gray-Mane, a Stormcloak-sympathizer who takes Balgruuf's place as Jarl should the Stormcloaks take over. Balgruuf knows where the loyalties of his citizens lie.)

Now stop pestering me with your war-mongering!

When the Stormcloaks finally attack, he drops the facade and admits he thinks of Ulfric as nothing but a barbarian sending innocents to their deaths over a senseless cause. It's especially apparent in the Imperial victory speech he gives following the Battle of Whiterun, where he condemns Ulfric *with his own speeches and catchphrase,* stating that a ""true Nord"" would have stayed loyal to Talos' Empire.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech

He's the one Jarl who straight up helps you in the main plot (Elisif and Ulfric are tangentially involved, but only because their war is fueling the flames) and even helps you capture Odahviing. And when the Stormcloaks attack Whiterun, he *personally* will defend his town in full plate mail. Averted, however, in the Stormcloak Battle for Whiterun, where he basically holes up in his castle and acts as an overglorified end-boss.

While ""barbarism"" is a disrespectful misconception of cultures just as advanced as the Empire, several provinces have been shown to beat up on each other and fight internally whenever an Empire has been absent, such as the Great House wars in Morrowind, the Crown-Forbear conflicts in Hammerfell, and the repeated sackings of Orsinium. And let's not forget the long, chaotic, bloody interregnum that raged on for over 400 years before the Empire was rebuilt, destabilizing much of Tamriel. Furthermore, many of the Jarls, regardless of alignment, have been shown to be either corrupt or incompetent, further worsening Skyrim's situation.

-   Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone is disinterested in the civil war and she joined the Empire despite her hatred for the Thalmor.
-   Jarl Siddgeir was put in power because his uncle supported the Stormcloaks and Siddgeir fully supports the Thalmor.

However, this *has* been after numerous attempts to impress upon Balgruuf that Stormcloaks are moving about his borders, so he's a bit exasperated with Balgruuf's obstinacy. That said, Tullius does end up sending men to aid Balgruuf after he is convinced of an imminent attack on Whiterun.

Although it is ultimately up to the player, that incident incited *a lot* of players to join [the Stormcloaks](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance), as well as making the Empire look like a bunch of bloodthirsty, oppressive invaders in the eyes of newcomers to the *Elder Scrolls* series (which are likely many, considering *Skyrim*'s numerous re-releases over the years).

-   Basically, just her being so obnoxious could have cost the Empire the entire civil war. Tullius had Ulfric captured and about to be executed, so the civil war was basically over. Then by acting like a complete [Jerkass](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass) even in the wake of Alduin's attack, she draws the ire of the Dragonborn, potentially sending them on a warpath that involves joining up with the Stormcloaks and kicking the Empire out of Skyrim virtually all on their own.

If you play the Dark Brotherhood and Stormcloak storylines simultaneously, Ulfric will refuse to attack Solitude so long as the Emperor, or his cousin Vittoria Vici, is present. He knows full well that though killing them might be a short-term victory, but it would mean that with the high profile murder of their ruler, the Empire would no longer have any excuse to ignore the threat of the Stormcloak Rebellion, and would have to bring the full might of the Imperial military down upon them, which would all but certainly result in a quick and crushing defeat for the rebels. The Stormcloak Rebellion can only succeed because the Empire does not consider it a serious enough threat to invest anything but the barest minimum amount of force possible in suppressing it, allowing them to keep the majority of their forces on the border with their equal-strength rival, the Aldmeri Dominion.

../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,Stormcloaks,The Stormcloaks,Fantastic Racism,0," [Fantastic Racism](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism): A common criticism of the Stormcloaks is their nativism as it often encourages rampant racism in their group, with varying degrees of accuracy.<ul>
-   Part of this is just due to general background intolerance among Skyrim's Nords. All the holds, Imperial or Stormcloak, ban the Khajiit caravans from entering. ""Skyrim belongs to the Nords"" is a popular battlecry among Nords both within and without the Stormcloaks and Skyrim society, in general, doesn't think too highly of elves due to a long history of warfare between the races, with the Great War being only the most recent example. So whether a random Stormcloak is more racist than a random Nord is an open question.
-   The Stormcloak-aligned jarls have different reasons for supporting the Stormcloaks, ranging from loyalty, nativism, and to personal gain.<ul>
-   Laila Law-Giver has two Bosmers in her court (one is her steward while the other is a court mage). She supports the Stormcloaks solely because she believes Ulfric's claim to the throne is legitimate and is mostly ignorant of her people's needs. She does have doubts about Ulfric but puts these feelings aside.
-   Skald the Elder is paranoid about Imperial spies in his hold, something The Empire is known to do. He does have a Breton, Madena, as his court mage.
-   Korir is openly distrustful of magic and sides with Ulfric because he's the only one who listens to his concerns. He does have a Dunmer as a steward but he only employed him because he wrongly assumed Malur Seloth was connected to The College of Winterhold.
-   Dengeir of Stuhn supports the Stormcloaks because he believes they care more about Skyrim than the Empire does, even if he distrusts Ulfric's motives for the war.
-   Vignar Grey-Mane only cares about Skyrim's beliefs and traditions, he makes it clear to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater that it's nothing personal and he would have left well enough alone if the Empire had just allowed him to worship Talos without fear of torture. When he becomes the Jarl of Whiterun, his family will occupy Dragonsreach.
-   Thongvor Silver-Blood hates The Empire for creating the White-Gold Concordat with the Thalmor and believes he's being shunted aside by the Jarl. His steward is an Imperial, Reburrus Quintilius, who was presumably chosen because of his financial skills. The Silver-Bloods are more concerned about profit and eradicating the Forsworn.</ul>
-   Windhelm, as the seat of Ulfric's power and thus most directly shaped by his policies, is seen as an example of what Stormcloak-run Skyrim will look like. The city has vast racial inequalities with rampant bigotry; [its version of the introduction to the city scene the major Holds get](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment) features two Nords threatening a Dunmer woman. The Dunmer are forced to live exclusively in the ghetto of the Gray Quarter and are a clear underclass to the Nords, while the Argonians are treated even worse and aren't allowed into the city. However, while Ulfric is established to be apathetic to the struggles of the Dunmer, it's also pointed out that a large, destitute refugee population moving into a city is going to be at a financial and social disadvantage and the Dunmer's problems are partially their own fault for their refusal to assimilate.
-   The Stormcloak leadership officially has no problems with other races, they simply value loyalty to Skyrim which Nords logically tend to have more of. Unofficially, there is a clear Nord bias in their thinking. Ulfric holds that all ""True Nords"" will support them and Galmar states that he fights because he refuses to let elves rule over men. A Dragonborn of any race will be asked why they wish to fight for Skyrim, with a Nord having the question of why a foreigner would care as opposed to the other races being asked why a member of their race would care. Even an Altmer Dragonborn can become a high-ranking and well-regarded warrior for the cause, but how much of this is them [being one of the good ones](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace) is open to interpretation.
-   The rank and file have a wide degree of variation in terms of racism, from those that think highly of other races and simply want Skyrim to be politically independent to those who openly disdain any non-Nords and yearn specifically for Nords being back on top.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism

../data/ElderScrolls/Skyrim/,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,Stormcloaks,The Stormcloaks,Informed Attribute,0," [Informed Attribute](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute): One element of their racism gets this through [Gameplay and Story Segregation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation). When the Stormcloaks conquer Whiterun, Adrianne Avenicci states that they tend to do business exclusively at Nord-run shops and that she would have gone out of business if she wasn't married to a Nord. However, given the [Space Compression](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCompression) that results in most cities only having one or two of each type of shop, this would result in crippling the player's ability to do business in those cities if this was put into practice.

Ulfric himself shows himself to be a complex and layered person — at times he acts humble and doubts his worthiness, other times he shows himself to be confident and bold regarding his rebellion.

When Ulfric obliged, the Imperial authorities (under pressure from the Dominion) reneged their terms and arrested him. This was the last straw for Ulfric - he lost all faith in an Empire he now saw as a crumbling shadow of what it once was, full of Thalmor appeasers and unworthy successors who demanded the blood of the Nord people but would not bleed for them, and so he began to plot a rebellion to drive them out of Skyrim for good.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn

-   There is also the fact that he cut his teeth as a field commander against the Forsworn, whose grievances against the Nords mirror the Nords' against the Empire pretty exactly.

Even without this interpretation, there are moments like his challenge to Torygg. Ulfric and his followers claim the duel wasn't a murder since both men agreed to fight, while members of Torygg's court note that, if Torygg had actually refused, Ulfric could have used that as proof he was unfit to be High King and called a Moot to depose him. There is also the issue that in Nord culture, that while challenging someone to a formal [Duel to the Death](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath) is an acceptable way to settle a conflict, it is also generally viewed as an incredibly harsh way of doing so and only something that should be done in the event that all attempts to find a diplomatic solution to said conflict have been exhausted; something which Ulfric's critics will notice he *didn't* do before challenging Torygg.

His reason for killing King Torygg was that he saw him as a weak ruler inherently unworthy of the throne, and some of his anti-Empire arguments have shades of this, particularly his rant to an Imperial Dragonborn delivering Balgruuf's axe:
QUOTE **Ulfric:** I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak. I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength. There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff. The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it! *I* demand it!

-   A bit averted though, in that immediately prior to the game's start, Ulfric falls right into a trap set by Tullius that ends with his capture.

If the Dragonborn kills a Thalmor in an Imperial city, they will only receive a 40 gold bounty for assault instead of a 1000 gold bounty for murder. The Stormcloaks won't even do that, instead placing bets on how painfully the Thalmor will be killed.

Even later, in the last few decades of the Second Era, the Thalmor was a congress of Altmer diplomats and Bosmer chieftains specifically responsible for helping administer *Valenwood*, not the overall Dominion.

On the other, after that initial advance, they started running into major problems and captured the Imperial City as a means to end a war that had spiraled out of their control, and were eventually totally defeated at the Battle of the Red Ring, but had inflicted almost equal damage on the Empire, and still occupied southern Hammerfell and most of Cyrodiil at the end. Subsequently, they were driven out of their part of Hammerfell, likely due to the losses they suffered at the end of the Great War. However, they are unquestionably *masters* of intelligence and covert operations and at manipulating other factions from behind the scenes. This was how they managed to first come to power and take Valenwood and Elsweyr, as well as how they managed to wipe out the Blades.

-   Despite insisting that his brother is better at talking than he is, and Eorlund remarking that none of the Companions know how to operate the Skyforge, he has extremely high Speech and Smithing stats; he also has extremely high Sneak and Pickpocket stats that aren't even remotely hinted at in-game.<ul>
-   The Smithing, at least, bears out a little if the Dragonborn marries him, as he can often be found using the anvil if living in a player home which has one.

He's also the Master trainer for the Heavy Armor skill, and the placement of a lute in his Jorrvaskr bedroom suggests that he's musically inclined.<ul>
-   If he becomes the Dragonborn's spouse and moves into a player home, he'll keep himself busy with pursuits you wouldn't expect.

The *Skyrim* chapter of the guild, though, is much more ruthless — they extort money from people who can't afford it, are comparatively lax on their ""no killing"" rules, and if anyone who doesn't fall in line with their demands, the Guild will blackmail them, plant stolen property in their house to frame them for the theft, or just beat them up. To make this distinction clear, the first two quests you get from them are to steal a ring from one merchant and plant it in another's pocket (both merchants are perfectly nice and have done nothing wrong), and the second is to extort money from three shopkeepers through either verbal or physical intimidation. This is explained in three ways:<ol>
-   The Guild has fallen on hard times and is struggling to make ends meet, hence their more brutal methods of getting funds;
-   They're  (SPOILER) under the leadership of Mercer Frey, a selfish bastard who's only in it for his own greed and cares nothing about the Guild's traditions or well-being .
-   Both *Oblivion* and *Morrowind*, the games where they are noticeably more Robin Hood-esque <sup>note </sup>  *Daggerfall's* characterisation is less clear, but some of their random quests suggest they aren't that far from *Skyrim's*, with quests involving drug smuggling and shaking down merchants , have their Guild chapters' behaviour explained in part by special situations or deliberate strategies that do not apply to the Skyrim chapter.</ol>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass

(SPOILER) This is entirely justified, since Mercer is planning to run out on the Guild and leave it to fall apart.

He will also  (SPOILER) come looking for you after you and Mercer go missing, according to Vekel.
