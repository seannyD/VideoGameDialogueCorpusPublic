				"Your liege? Who might that be? Oh, I think I've just remembered! You must mean that old fool who refused to surrender up this kingdom. Yes, that's it - the king of Baron! It's his part I've been playing all this time. Ha ha ha ha ha!",
				"Would you like to go and see him, this king of yours? You'd best not mistake me for another Scarmiglione. How one as weak as he came to be crowned an archfiend is something I will never know. Mwa ha ha!",
				"Does it, now? Indeed. Your loyalty and worth are proven once again, Captain Baigan. But the Crystal is all that matters. Bring him before me.",
				"The kingdom of Baron hails your return, Cecil. You have brought me the Crystal, I trust?",
				"So it is. See how it shines! That will be all, Cecil. You may leave us now.",
				"Have you some other matter to discuss?",

				"Do you take me for a fool, Cecil? Do you think your treasonous whisperings escape my ears? After all I've done for you, Cecil... You wound me. This is most unfortunate, but I can place no trust in one who offers none in return. I hereby relieve you of command of the Red Wings.",
				"You will go now of the Valley of Mist instead. There is a task I would have you do. A phantom creature haunts the borders of that land - the Eidolon of Mist. You will slay it, and deliver this ring to the village that lies beyond - they will know its meaning. Be gone at first light on the morrow.",
				"Ah, Kain. I was not aware this matter concerned you. But as you seem so eager to protect your friend, let your spear accompany his blade on the road to Mist.",
				"I've no more words. Take the ring and begone, while my mood is yet fair!"
