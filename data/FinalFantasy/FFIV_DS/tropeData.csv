However against Golbez's dark army of fiends, monsters and undead the power of Darkness is a very poor match up (since they themselves are empowered by it) and Cecil quickly finds himself hitting a wall in Fabul where his fight against Golbez's forces goes terribly. It's only after he gives up the Dark Knight path and becomes a Paladin that Cecil is truely able to start making headway against the enemy.

The King of Baron strips Cecil of his station at the beginning of the game for questioning orders and [showing concern for the people of Mysidia that he recently besieged](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedForSympathy), and it is unclear if Cecil ever regains his position following his coronation.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass

It's not until he sees his dark side [either kill his brother Golbez or about to kill Ceodore](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeButton) [that he snaps](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather) [out of it](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf) and [returns to being the ass-kicker we all know](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack) .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD

Both the King of Fabul and Elder of Mysidia tell Cecil he cannot hope to defeat Golbez if he relies upon the power he gained following the path of the Dark Knight, and the latter clearly spells out that, in hunting monsters, Cecil runs risk of becoming one himself should he continue to let his soul be tainted by darkness.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters

However this mostly will be overlooked because swords are his best weapons in almost all situations. This does come in handy in the Lodestone Cave/Magnetic Cavern however, as the magnetic field will make it so using a sword will paralyze him.

-   Rydia's a bit famous for running into this *often*; her exact eye color and the details of her outfit vary between different games, artists and graphical styles. Since the DS release her appearance has mostly stuck, but eye color still shifts around, usually between green and blue, with the occasional dip into grey.
-   The most notable and oft-remarked-on divergence, though, stands between Kazuko Shibuya's sprites of Rydia as a child and most other depictions (including Yoshitaka Amano's own concept art of her). Across both the original battle sprites (in the SNES and GBA versions) and the *Pixel Remaster*, Shibuya consistently depicts child Rydia as wearing a knee-length blue *dress*, trimmed with golden yellow, with a matching yellow cape-slash-cloak, a pair of sandals with purple-pink lacing (which matches her armbands and hair decoration, thanks to palette limitations) and a somewhat messy bobbed haircut that ends right about at the nape of her neck. The *Pixel Remaster* even takes pains to ensure that the new Rydia field sprite matches the battle sprite precisely, which the origial SNES one could not for complex technical reasons. The DS version of Rydia (and the PSP sprites and other various derivative pieces based off that), meanwhile, depicts child Rydia with much longer hair (going past her shoulders), a yellow *sash*, similar to a sarong, around her waist, fully foot-enclosing slippers, a short green capelet... and a blue-and-green *leotard* for the outfit's centerpiece. While this is technically a little closer to Yoshitaka Amano's original concept art, it has, for obvious reasons, been somewhat contentious as an aesthetic choice for a seven-year-old ever since it debuted.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist
