In addition, her [Guilt Complex](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex) causes her to be *deeply* hard on herself for the mistakes she makes, and even things that were outside of her control, causing her to have a [Heroic BSoD](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD) in Disc 3 following Alexandria's destruction. Fortunately, her [Character Development](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment) allows her to move past her guilt and blossom into a proper version of this trope, being a front-line fighter against Kuja in Disc 4, and the epilogue shows her having become [The High Queen](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething

That said, training Quina into having a full arsenal rewards the player with one of the best Blue Mages in the series, as Quina now can function as a better healer than Garnet or Eiko, a damage dealer only rivaled by Zidane and Freya, the ability to hit elemental weaknesses with better efficiency than Vivi, and a combination buffer and debuffer that outshines Amarant.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower

Her interest in him implicitly stems from being the last summoner after her grandfather died just the year prior, so she knows she's going to have to [rebuild the tribe](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyYouCanRepopulateMyRace). Even so, she's **six**; she has no business pursuing a serious romantic relationship with as much skill and determination as she does. <sup>note </sup>  The game thankfully doesn't touch on the question of if Eiko is actually aware of the ""physical"" aspects of a relationship, possibly to keep her crush on Zidane from being *too* uncomfortable.

The other half center around reviving his fallen allies, healing them, or allowing them to revive after they're knocked out.

Despite Garland beating him to the punch on destroying Alexandria, Kuja still effectively vanquishes the four major kingdoms of the Mist Continent with very little effort. Even during Disc 3, he still manipulates the party into doing most of his dirty work for him.

He puts on exaggerated efforts to seem sophisticated and intelligent to assert his individuality, is very narcissistic and selfish, and is prone to quickly losing his temper when he doesn't get his way. According to creation materials, this is why Garland created Zidane as a baby — he would be able to grow and mature in order to develop the complex emotions needed to enter [Trance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode), while Kuja was created as an adult and never matured emotionally beyond the young mindsets of regular Genomes.

He even manages to damage the Original Crystal, as per his original intent. The only reason he fails to destroy everything is because he had no idea that Necron existed and needed to destroy reality himself in order for Crystal to truly be undone.

The only reason why Kuja wasn't put down the moment he showed signs of instability was because Garland believed that he might be useful — at least until a stronger Genome was available to replace him, whereupon he'd simply be disposed of. Thus, gaining power strong enough to overpower that hypothetical genome and eventually overthrow Garland was the only way for Kuja to ensure his survival.

Garland knew Kuja was going to betray him a long time ago, and took steps to prepare for it. This surprises and scares the hell out of Kuja when he realizes it, and he has to completely scrap his entire [Evil Plan](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan) and start from scratch.

Garland explicitly states that he's a stopgap for the next model (Zidane) and nothing more.

In fact, the only reason why Kuja's activities on Gaia were permitted were because most of them benefited Garland in some way - until the battle of Alexandria. Similarly, once Zidane makes it clear that he can't be convinced to become his Angel of Death, Garland rips his soul out, intending to reduce him to another Genome vessel.

He created Kuja, who, at Garland's behest, encouraged Brahne to pursue her desire for conquest. He gave Kuja the materials to produce magical weaponry, which he would then sell to Brahne — resulting in greater destruction and further casualties in the war across the Mist Continent.

Garland is completely at peace with his purpose as a glorified steward for the Terrans and is calmly uncompromising on his plan to terraform Gaia into a new Terra.

However, where Kuja is a [Large Ham](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam) who likes to behave as flamboyantly as possible, Garland is calm, composed, and rarely acts with any kind of drama; where Kuja is actively cruel and sadistic, Garland is simply pragmatic to the point of ignoring the suffering of others; where Kuja is relentlessly selfish, Garland acts only for the sleeping Terrans and has seemingly no desires of his own; where Kuja refuses to admit defeat even when he has nothing to gain except total destruction, Garland willingly aids Zidane in order to prevent the destruction of the universe.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil

Also, after Kuja murders him and destroys Terra, Garland returns to assist Zidane on his journey through Memoria, even though Zidane's interference made said destruction possible.

For example, when the summoners of Madain Sari grew too powerful for him to tolerate, Garland carpet-bombed their village into dust; when Kuja tried to take control of the eidolon Alexander, Garland simply assumed control of the *Invincible* and destroyed Alexander with two shots, forcing Kuja into a humiliating defeat; finally, the moment he learned that Zidane would never willingly serve him, Garland just ripped his soul out.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis

-   Fittingly, given how much inspiration *Final Fantasy* takes from *[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind)*, his scheme and motives are reminiscent of the manga's main antagonist,  (SPOILER) the Crypt of Shuwa, a biological program designed by the old humans to purify the Earth from its polluted state. Ultimately, its goal was to cleanse the world, including all the new humans that adapted to it, so that old humanity could be reborn from stasis. Much like Nausicaä's Earth, Terra was a dying world that sought to assimilate Gaia so that its population could be reborn there.
