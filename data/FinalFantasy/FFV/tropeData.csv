QUOTE **Kefka:** Why do people insist on creating things that will inevitably be destroyed? Why do people cling to life, knowing that they must someday die? ...Knowing that none of it will have meant anything once they do?  
**Terra:** Because it's not the end that matters! It's knowing that you have something to live for right now, at this moment! Something you've worked for... something that's worth protecting! As long as you have that...that's enough!

Kefka, being a [Straw Nihilist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist) subject to [Sanity Slippage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage), shows the dark side of this trope when his rampant thirst for destruction eventually leads him to the conclusion that everything exists only to be destroyed, preferably by him.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment

Meanwhile Celes takes over the initial character for the second half and features prominently in the first, Locke plays as [The Lancer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer) to Terra and Celes for much of the game, and Edgar and Sabin are important characters throughout the game to a lesser extent.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFV/,Final Fantasy V,Terra Branford,Terra Branford,Depending on the Artist,0," [Depending on the Artist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist): One of the most infamous cases in the series. Not only is Terra's hair a different color from concept art to in-game appearance, but her outfit is also substantially different.<ul>
-   Originally the design team decided to give Terra green hair because Celes was already blond. They also designed the character sprites *first* before handing off their work to Yoshitaka Amano which was the opposite order of the previous games. Tetsuya Nomura later stated in an interview that had Amano started with the character art, he would have always given Terra blond hair.
-   The green hair was her signature look up until *Dissidia*, which gave her blonde hair since everyone in that game was based mostly on their original concept art. Since then the blonde hair became the usual look for her, but the green hair continues to pop up, particularly in sprite-based cameos (but not just them).
-   Her sprite and SD artwork depict her with a red minidress, no tights, and a large pair of purple shoulder pads, while her concept art shows her in a red minidress with tights, no shoulder pads, and a pink cape. The original *Dissidia* based her design on her concept art and so went with the tights and cape, while her alt outfit removes the tights and gives her the green hair in reference to her game sprite. The arcade *Dissidia* gives her a more faithful variant of this outfit that removes the cape and adds the shoulder pads to complete the sprite-inspired look.
-   Later games after *Dissidia* tie her hair color and dress design together — the blonde hair goes with the tights and cape look, and the green hair goes with the no tights and shoulder pads look. Aside from the arcade *Dissidia*, *Record Keeper* includes both her designs, though with the green-haired one as the default and the blonde-haired one as the alt. Other games mostly stick to one design or the other now.
-   This also applies to Terra's eye color, which has variously been blue, [green](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindow), or purple. These days she's *mostly* settled on a purple-ish blue.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist

However, later in the game the power of his Rages in proportion to normal magic and other special attacks begins to level out. By the end of the game his Berserk status when using Rages heavily hampers his effectiveness, though he remains capable, especially as a [Tank](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall).

Move them out of alignment and the imbalance of power drastically reshapes the known world, which is exactly what Kefka does once he sends Gestahl flying.

-   Gold Dragon when first fought will charge up for some time... To use Bolt 3/Thundaga, which was already being used halfway through the *World of Balance*.

-   Gold Dragon has permanent [Runic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic) status, and, as such, absorbs all but few specific spells such as [Flood](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash).
-   Skull Dragon endlessly revives itself when killed - unless you kill them by [Rasping](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn) until the dragon runs out of MP.

In contrast, his buddy Typhon, who was named Chupon in the SNES version, was properly named Typhon in all installments ever since, with the exception of the original PS1 version of *[Final Fantasy VII](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII)*, where he was named Typoon. <sup>note </sup>  It got changed back to Typhon in the PC release, as well as all future releases of the game which use the PC version's script.

Then even later he's at Crescent Island plotting to steal some statues to impress Siegfried, who Ultros has never even mentioned before. Then somehow he's flying in with the Imperial Air Force on Typhon, also never mentioned or seen before but suddenly he's Ultros' accomplice.

In the battle against him in Crescent Mountain, he mouths off to Relm, a little girl who just wanted to paint his picture.
