This is why Cloud's narration tends to trail off and get murky throughout the flashback like he has trouble remembering much beyond a few incidental scenes.

Accordingly, the protagonists are a plucky band of eco-terrorists doing their utmost to sabotage Shinra's businesses.

-   To Zack. His quest to become a hero contrasts with the same quest Genesis Rhapsodos undertakes, but whereas the latter's feelings of entitlement to the moniker of ""hero"" lead to obsession and downfall, Zack's quest to ""become a hero"" has less to do with personal glory and more with making the world a better place. Zack's will to become a hero motivated him to think for himself and to be guided by his moral compass and sense of justice, whereas Genesis's obsession with becoming a hero drove him to challenge those he saw as hindrances and a need to prove himself as superior to others. Both joined SOLDIER inspired by stories of the hero First Class Sephiroth, striving to emulate him, and both fall from Shinra's graces after learning of the company's corrupt ways. In an inversion of a typical hero-villain story dynamic, Zack dies whereas Genesis lives.
-   To Angeal as well. They are both SOLDIERs of Project G, both were inspired by Sephiroth to join SOLDIER and both can create copies of themselves. However Genesis and his copies are associated with black wings, whereas Angeal and his copies are associated with white wings, alluding to angel/fallen angel imagery.

However, Sephiroth does so because he comes to think he's an Ancient and should rule the planet; Genesis is trying to save his own life and is resorting to desperate stretches of reason to find a way. Even their designs play into this; Genesis is short-haired, right-handed, has a wing on his left side, and wields a massive straight-bladed sword that he infuses with magic, while Sephiroth is long-haired, [left-handed](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHandedMirror), with a wing on the right side, and he wields a katana that he never empowers.

-   The second is when Zack defeats him during the [Final Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss) battle.

-   As a SOLDIER, he's a normal human that has been injected with Jenova's cells. However they manifest differently in him than in Sephiroth due to the different nature of how they received the cells, which is the major reason for his rebellion against Shinra; Genesis' genes are unstable and when he's injured in a sparring match, his body begins to undergo cellular degradation. This first shows itself when he manifests a black wing, but as the game goes on and his condition worsens, his hair lightens to white, and his skin begins to crack and scar.
-   The Genesis Copies created by grafting his cells onto humans take on his facial appearance and hair, but they also experience the same degradation he does at an accelerated rate. The result is that while a few of them look identical to Genesis, others look even more monstrous than he does to the point they're barely recognizable as human anymore, such as the [G-Warrior strains<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/File:G_Devastator_Artwork.jpg)<small>◊</small>.

-   More literally, while Genesis isn't the cause behind all of major problems in the world of *Final Fantasy VII* (that can be laid on Hojo's hands), he *did* instigate Sephiroth's loss of sanity in Nibelheim, and thus is partially to blame for Sephiroth becoming such a major threat to the planet in *VII* and later works.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII/,Final Fantasy VII,Sephiroth,Sephiroth,Depending on the Writer,0," [Depending on the Writer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter): His depictions vary wildly.<ul>
-   *Final Fantasy VII* depicted him as obsessed with his mother and wanting to become a god in her name; *Advent Children* has invoked [Flanderization](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) as described below, with him focusing on his rivalry and hatred for Cloud; *Crisis Core* explores his pre-madness [Sugar and Ice](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIce) personality where he's a nice guy who is just tough to get to know; *Kingdom Hearts* retools him as Cloud's [Enemy Without](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout) existing to [Troll](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll) him and goad him into fighting; *Dissidia* sees him as a [Punch-Clock Villain](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain) interested only in recovering his memories with no loyalty to Chaos or Cosmos otherwise. Depending on the game you pick up, Sephiroth can be a mass-murdering sociopath, a respectful [Worthy Opponent](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent), a delusional man with a God Complex, or some combination of them all.
-   His power levels also fluctuate, mostly to keep him balanced against other characters in each game. He may be an [Empowered Badass Normal](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal) master swordsman, or he may have god-like top-tier magical abilities.
-   Numerous materials and creator statements vary on if Sephiroth is [The Chessmaster](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) or [The Pawn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn) to Jenova. Mostly it's implied Sephiroth [assumed complete control of her](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackingCthulhu), but it's also heavily implied that some of her nature and instincts began influencing him in return, and some creation materials say that it was Jenova controlling him and not the other way around.
-   His first death also varies between media. *Crisis Core* and *Final Fantasy VII* show that Cloud managed to use [Heroic Willpower](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower) and Sephiroth's injured state to his advantage and throw him into the Lifestream. <img class=""trivia1 rounded"" src=""/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png"" title=""This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

-   He's initially presented as one to Cloud, being his former partner and an ex-SOLDIER who went rogue.

-   As the game continues it emerges he's more this trope to Aerith, once Cloud's real history is revealed and more of Aerith's comes to light. Both Sephiroth and Aerith are children of Shinra scientists involved in the Jenova Project, both use angelic symbolism, both survive dissolution in the Lifestream, and both are linked to one of the Ultimate Magics, the Black and White Materia. Sephiroth believed that his mother was an Ancient whereas Aerith's mother actually was one. Also, Aerith was a child of love between Prof. Gast and Ifalna, while Sephiroth was the loveless child of  (SPOILER)  Hojo and Lucrecia , meant to be an experiment. Both of them grew up in not exactly healthy environments, and all their lives, they both wanted to reject their obviously unnatural natures, simply wanting to be normal, until, eventually, they had to face what they were. But while Aerith's acceptance of her Cetra nature made her willing to save the world, even at the cost of her life, Sephiroth decided to exterminate everyone else and the Planet, and install himself as a being above all others. The novella ""Case of the Lifestream"" notes that in the events leading up to *Advent Children*, Aerith considered creating her own avatars on the surface to help fight Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo, but decided it was more important to contact Cloud herself and let him handle it.

In the Japanese version, he just conjures an exploding star that deals a significant amount of damage and only destroys a few planets.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation

Hojo (whose work Sephiroth considers inferior to Gast, implying he is read up on both) concedes that Sephiroth outsmarted him  (SPOILER)  like father like son  and proved impossible to predict, and he shows himself to be a brilliant [chessmaster](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) and [Manipulative Bastard](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard) of the highest order once Disc 2 gets going and reveals that he's been playing you like a fiddle the entire game.

It really doesn't help that his own parents experimented on him while he was still in the womb, not to mention [Genesis](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe) deciding to [Kick the Dog](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog) at the *exact* wrong time in an attempt to goad Sephiroth into curing him.

Unfortunately this all [shatters](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal) after Sephiroth snaps and burns down Cloud's village, killing Cloud's mother in the process.

During the flashback of the sparring session gone wrong in *Crisis Core*, and how he described it, Sephiroth reminisced like it was him at his happiest, that he could have friends he could just be a normal dude with. But that session revealing Genesis' envy, and the entire fallout, ended up as a reminder that he was different.

The story itself and *Advent Children* further show that though his physical bodies can be killed (with great difficulty mind) you are effectively [Fighting a Shadow](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow) as his soul and consciousness survives in the Lifestream as a kind of poison and he can return from death pretty much indefinitely, though the process of doing so may weaken him each time and diminish his personality.

(SPOILER) That doesn't mean he's above using his knowledge of Cloud's fractured psyche as a tool to [Mind Rape](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape) him when it suits his needs, however, and he even manages to outright possess Cloud a few times due to Cloud himself possessing Jenova cells . Then Cloud kills him, both physically *again* and as the remnant in his psyche, and that's when the [Motive Decay](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay) sets in as Sephiroth enacts this trope against him.

All he knew of his past was that he'd been told his mother's name was Jenova. His [Sanity Slippage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage) started when he found Jenova's chamber and the makonoid containment units inside the reactor, and was told by Genesis that he was created by Shinra to be the ultimate monster.

Instead, he goes the extra mile to drag Cloud to the [Despair Event Horizon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon) just to be [spiteful](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty) and make extra use of him as a puppet for delivering the Black Materia.. and then let him be tossed aside to die with the emergent Weapons and the rest of the world.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog

But once he discovers his origins, Sephiroth's personality is completely twisted, the first sign of his sociopathy manifesting with a newfound desire for bloodshed and an extreme obsession with his mother figure, JENOVA. By the events of the main game, Sephiroth is most commonly associated with an incredibly cold, antisocial demeanor that always persists whenever he's in anyone's presence. His monologue after killing Aerith is one where he doesn't care about feelings and emotions and is completely unmoved and unfazed by anything in his desire to destroy the world for his own ends.

Not only that, but even after proving himself as a highly revered individual in SOLDIER, it forced him into conflict with some of the only people he was ever able to make friends with, and he lost all of them one way or another.
