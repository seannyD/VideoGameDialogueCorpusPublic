When asked his feelings about opposing an enemy who is ""pure evil,"" Squall reflects that he's not so sure there's any such thing, considering good and evil to be largely a matter of perspective. This happens before the guiding hand of character development sets in, but even late in the game he remains motivated more by the desire to protect Rinoa and the rest of his friends than by any sense of ""the right thing to do.""",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil

(SPOILER) He gets lost in time after defeating Ultimecia and wanders around aimlessly, alone, a fittingly ironic fate given his antisocial behavior earlier in the game.

If you look at his entire persona, it's very much like how a child would think a ""tough adult"" would act; beneath it, he is insecure and emotionally immature, and more caring than he likes to let on.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVIII/,Final Fantasy VIII,Squall Leonhart,Squall Leonhart,BFS,0," [BFS](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS): Revolver doesn't quite cut it, but the later models, especially the Twin Lance, the Punishment and the Lion Heart, are pretty hefty.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVIII/,Final Fantasy VIII,Squall Leonhart,Squall Leonhart,Bloodless Carnage,0," [Bloodless Carnage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage): After the fight with Edea and Seifer at the end of disc 1, Squall gets hit by an icicle in the shoulder courtesy of Edea. Although it is hard to see a closeup of both his front and back wound, no blood has been spilled on the ground as seen in the overhead shot of Squall falling down. In fact, the next time we see him, the injury is nowhere to be found on him and he seems to have recovered from it just fine.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVIII/,Final Fantasy VIII,Squall Leonhart,Squall Leonhart,Broken Ace,0, [Broken Ace](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce): Much of the student body of Balamb looks up to and admires Squall due to his incredible fighting skills and calm professionalism despite his lone wolf attitude. This tends to confound the emotionally stunted Squall who created his cold-hearted and powerful persona to be strong enough to not have to deal with other people. He mends his breaks and grows into [The Ace](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce) proper during the game.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce

When she falls into a coma at the end of Disc 2, however, he realizes how much he doesn't want to lose her, and she becomes his main priority.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotStandThemCannotLiveWithoutThem

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVIII/,Final Fantasy VIII,Squall Leonhart,Squall Leonhart,The Chains of Commanding,0," [The Chains of Commanding](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding): It's the reason Squall gets ticked over Cid  (SPOILER) forcing him to lead Balamb Garden . Given that he's barely capable of coping with his own problems, the thought of assuming responsibility for the well-being of others under his command weighs on him almost to the point of paralysis.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVIII/,Final Fantasy VIII,Squall Leonhart,Squall Leonhart,Chuunibyou,0," [Chuunibyou](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou): Downplayed example, as the [Stoic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic) affectations he adopts, do not fall into any of the major subdivisions listed in the trope page, and nobody really accuses him of being childish. But what cannot be denied is that *Squall does not know how to adult*, and his attempts to fake it are fairly transparent.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou

-   He flat-out tells Rinoa that his job is to follow her orders, even if she commands them to take on impossible odds and sends them to certain death, because she's the client. His teammates agree with this. Rinoa does not.
-   The fact that he's paired with a [Ragtag Bunch of Misfits](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits) highlights this even more. The rest of his squad is highly idealistic, while Squall is (or tries to be) more emotionally detached.  (SPOILER) One particular scene has the group worrying over Seifer's fate after the latter has fallen into the hands of the sorceress; when Rinoa asks him, he bluntly informs her that it's likely he's already been executed, and that she shouldn't get her hopes up for his survival. 
-   A related scene shortly afterward illustrates how Squall *subverts* this trope when he blows a gasket over the thought of being referred to in the past tense  (SPOILER) because everyone is talking about what Seifer *was* like , showing that he's not as ""professionally"" detached as he wants to be.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateProfessional

-   He has a lot of trouble maintaining a leaderish mindset during Rinoa's coma. Specifically, he walks out of Garden with her on his back without telling anyone, deciding to find Ellone by himself.

Early Disc 2 shows a distinct contrast in Selphie being proactive in trying to stop a missile launch while Squall just goes back to Garden under her orders.

The two moves in question have the fewest number of button presses to execute, and therefore the quickest to pull off. While the fancier moves may do more damage per hit, the longer and more complicated input combinations and the setup required to unleash them means they take more time to execute; especially at higher levels when a good STR junction can mean every individual hit reaches the damage cap, getting out as many hits as possible in the shortest amount of time is by far the most efficient means of racking up the highest total damage.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome

But put this into context: Seifer loses access to both the GFs and the Junction system upon his defection from Garden, which means he has been severely weakened and no longer has any way to artificially buff his capabilities. This doesn't stop him from still being deadly enough solo an entire Galbadian army unit or fight against the heroes in 3-against-1 confrontations, where he can easily kill an unprepared or underlevelled character in a single stroke. Lastly, Seifer was also able to learn how to draw and stock para-magic *without a GF and the Junction system* in a very short period of time after his [Face–Heel Turn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn), something which none of the cast (not even Edea!) were able to pull off.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass

Problem is, after he leaves Garden, Seifer loses access to the Guardian Force and Junction resources that SeeD use, so Squall treats him like more of a [Goldfish Poop Gang](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang) and he can never come even close to the party's strength.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp

Seifer is VERY obsessed with idea of being a Sorceress' Knight, and it's seriously affected his humility (or lack thereof) and morality. It's *mostly* kept under control while as a Garden student, but once he actually gets to be in the service of A Sorceress, it spirals out of control, leading to his [Tautological Templar](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar) mindset below and his villainous deeds in general.

Rinoa talks about how he spent the previous summer working with her and the Timber Owls in their resistance against the Galbadian occupation of Timber, and how helpful and inspiring he was. Some of the dialog between Seifer and Squall during the field exam indicates an odd sense of respect between the two and suggests that, in his overly aggressive way, Seifer thinks he is helping Squall by challenging him. And, of course, the entire reason he breaks out of Garden and goes to Timber in time to be drawn in by Edea is because he thinks they've been sent into more danger than they're equipped for and will need help.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths
