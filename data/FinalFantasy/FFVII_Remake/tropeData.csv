../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Adaptational Badass,0," [Adaptational Badass](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass): Cloud and company are noticeably a lot stronger from the start, able to fight at levels that go far beyond what their 1997 selves were capable of around the same time frame. For example, Reno from the original game's Sector 7 plate showdown managed to hold off Cloud, Barret and Tifa all by himself and even left under his own power, whereas in the remake, he not only has to rely on Rude for backup, but gets beaten up so badly that he has to be carried out by the end of the encounter. This upgrade in the heroes' fighting prowess eventually becomes a plot point,  (SPOILER) as defeating the all-powerful Arbiters of Fate opens up the future for the protagonists to overcome problems they couldn't before. Or mess them up worse . Likewise,  (SPOILER) while it's argued that being able to beat Safer Sephiroth at the end of the original suggests they can take down a being that can destroy a solar system (since his limit break, Supernova, involves the illusory destruction of the Solar System), by taking down the Arbiters of Fate, within the first fourth to third of the story, they've essentially shown the capacity to beat destiny itself . Another display of adaptational prowess is the fact that, while it took the entire party together to defeat  (SPOILER) Sephiroth in the original game, this time just five of them are already enough to fight and push him to a corner .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Adaptational Heroism,0," [Adaptational Heroism](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism): More like adaptational lack of [Anti-Heroism](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero), but, as opposed to the initial Bombing Run involving the reactor being destroyed by Avalanche's bomb, it only destroyed that smaller one inside, with the entire reactor's destruction being Shinra framing them.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,An Adventurer Is You,0," [An Adventurer Is You](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou): Each of the characters has a distinct role in battle, reflected in their unique mechanics and weapon types:<ul>
-   Cloud is a [Mighty Glacier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier), unleashing powerful but slow attacks on enemies, and his unique mechanic lets him use Punisher Mode to decrease his movement speed for a boost in damage output and countering blocked melee attacks. His normal attacks cover a large area around him, especially in Punisher Mode, letting him handle groups of enemies easier, and his unique abilities are just various extra-powerful attacks to heighten his offensive potential. As he's the main character and is [not removable from the party](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero) in most circumstances, he's also a [Jack of All Stats](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats) who doesn't need as much micromanagement of unique mechanics and is easy to play as, but he's a [Master of None](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone) who struggles to do well in fights with enemies that resist melee damage and/or don't use physical attacks that he can reliably counter.
-   Barret is a [Long-Range Fighter](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter), able to use his gun-arm to attack enemies from distance (though he has a few melee weapons). His unique mechanic Overcharge lets him unleash a massive barrage of gunfire, but it has a long cooldown he can hasten with the Recharge command; his normal attacks also have him stop to recharge his gun-arm every couple of seconds, so players can use the Recharge command to refresh his normal attacks and Overcharge at once, giving a sort of rhythm to his attack patterns. His ranged ATB skills consume all charges he currently has, but they deal more hits when he has two charges to expend instead of one. He also has elements of a [Stone Wall](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall), with unique abilities to draw damage away from allies and reducing the damage he takes, and he has the highest natural HP.
-   Tifa is a [Glass Cannon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon) who relies on [Combos](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combo) of kicks and punches to quickly build up an enemy's stagger gauge as well as her ATB bar. Using Tifa's default ATB ability Unbridled Strength increases her chi level, boosting the power of her attacks and upgrading her unique attack Whirlwind Uppercut to Omnistrike, and then to Rise &amp; Fall; each of these increases the stagger damage bonus against enemies, but the higher-level attacks consume chi to use. Her ATB skills also provide opportunities to combo into each other, helped by her unique attacks and her rapid-fire normal attacks quickly charging her ATB gauge, letting Tifa unleash a barrage of blows with proper technique and a bit of prep work. However, unlike other fighters, she doesn't have many defensive options, and her HP and Vitality growth are only slightly better than Aerith's, so she's not very durable.
-   Aerith is a [Squishy Wizard](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard) who attacks from range by firing [Energy Balls](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBall), thus her default attack is considered magic damage and she is the only character with such a status. She has the highest natural MP and Magic of the group, making her the best fit to be focused as a mage, but of course she has the lowest natural HP and Vitality. She's also a [Support Party Member](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember) with unique abilities related to [Field Power Effects](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPowerEffect), such as a shield that blocks incoming projectiles or wards that let party members in them dualcast offensive spells or absorb Aerith's ATB to increase their own. Her unique attack is Tempest, a magic attack that Aerith can charge for much greater power and area-of-effect damage.
-   Red XIII is a [Jack of All Stats](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats) who focuses on [Gathering Steam](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam). As he blocks damage his Vengeance Gauge builds up, and he can activate Vengeance Mode for a stat boost and a unique attack that damages enemies and heals him, but the power-up only lasts until the Vengeance Gauge depletes. Being in Vengeance Mode also powers up his ATB skills and turns him into a [Lightning Bruiser](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser) that can strike hard and fast, and he can build up stagger almost as well as Tifa. He also has elements of a [Support Party Member](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember), as several of his ATB skills let him consume the Vengeance Gauge to support his allies, and because Vengeance Mode encourages him to take damage to charge it up, he has aspects of a [Mighty Glacier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier) to help him tank damage easier.
-   Yuffie is a [Magic Knight](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight) and a ninja-themed [Mage Marksman](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageMarksman). She can use both melee attacks and magical attacks via her Ninjutsu, which she can imbue with an element, and her Attack and Magic Attack are both decent, allowing her to deal reliable damage to enemies that resist physical or magical attacks and hit elemental weaknesses to pressure enemies. However she has mediocre defenses and poor HP, and her stronger ATB skills are circumstantial and rely on her having a lot of ATB to spend, so she's more reliant than others on charging her ATB gauge to help her damage output, and she's the only character who needs United Refocus active to utilize one of her ATB skills. She's also a bit of a selfish character, as she learns no support abilities that let her help her allies.
-   Cait Sith is a [Mechanically Unusual Fighter](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualFighter) [Support Party Member](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMember). His base ATB skill summons his Moogle to help him out, and Cait can either ride the moogle to fight with it or jump off to fight on his own while the Moogle tanks damage and draws aggro away from him and his allies, as Cait is very fragile on his own. His other ATB skills have random effects, or need his Moogle out to be used and have more varied offensive attacks, including one that takes advantage of the Moogle being disposable by having it self-destruct. He also incorporates aspects of a [Critical Hit Class](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass); many of his weapons have a support ability that boosts his Luck by 100 points when riding on his Moogle, and he has an ATB skill that increases the party's critical hit rate. Finally, he has a unique skill that lets him briefly call out the Summon he's equipped with to use one of their normal commands, a feature that allows a lot of versatility in how it can be used but repeated uses take longer and the ability still isn't as strong as when the summon is called normally.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Art Evolution,0," [Art Evolution](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution): In stark contrast to the original game's blocky, anime art style, *Remake* goes with the stylized realistic look that the *Final Fantasy* series has been rolling with ever since *VIII*. Characters overall have had their designs overhauled or updated to fit with the new style, as well, and the end result is something that lies at around the midpoint between characters' original designs and the designs they were subsequently given in the *Compliation*.<ul>
-   Cloud's outfit, rather than being the darker purple it was in the original game, is now mostly pure black. His famous [Anime Hair](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair) has also been toned down to be a bit more realistic, though it's still obviously there.
-   Barret has had a *massive* wardrobe update. While his vest is still ripped at the sleeves, it now looks more stylized rather than improvised. He has more tactical gear added to him, like a bulletproof vest and some cargo clothing, as well as an overhaul of how his [Arm Cannon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon) is attached. In the original game, it was seamlessly attached to the end of his arm. Here, it has a large cloth covering to hide the spot where his gun connects to his arm.
-   Tifa has had her overall design made to look a bit more sporty. She now wears stockings, she wears a proper gauntlet on one of her arms rather than just an elbow pad, and she now wears a sports bra beneath her shirt.
-   Aerith has seen only subtle changes, as opposed to the overhauls of other characters, mainly in regards to her jewelry. The original game had her wearing some large metal bracelets, whereas here she now wears two sets of three more colorful bracelets. Her dress has also been given some additional details toward the bottom.
-   Yuffie's signature arm cover is now segmented to resemble armor, rather than just being one large piece of clothing. She now wears a holster on one leg and now also wears a belt, too.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,"Balance, Power, Skill, Gimmick",0," [Balance, Power, Skill, Gimmick](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancePowerSkillGimmick):<ul>
-   *Remake*: Cloud is the balance, with a solid spread of stats and abilities. Barret, the power who is geared towards bringing overwhelming offensive force down on enemies. Tifa is the skill, she is equipped to bring enemies down into pressure status the fastest and capitalize on it with her unique attacks. Aerith is the gimmick, uniquely she is the party's dedicated mage who has specialized techniques to facilitate more magical playstyles.
-   *Rebirth*: The second game adds Yuffie as another Balance with her even spread of stats and abilities, like Cloud. Barret is still the only Power, but Red XIII is added as another Skill alongside Tifa with his Vengeance mechanic requiring use of blocking as another type of resource management. Cait Sith joins Aerith in Gimmick, in that he gets new abilities when mounting his moogle and his playstyle changes, and in general his abilities rely on setting traps or using luck.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancePowerSkillGimmick
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Birds of a Feather,0," [Birds of a Feather](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather): In contrast to the guys, Aerith and Tifa hit it off immediately. However, the game makes it clear that this is not the cliché ""[Women Are Wiser](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser)"" trope at work, rather the two women just click with each other.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Character Check,0," [Character Check](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCheck): A lot of the characters are moved closer to a more fleshed-out version of their original characterization, as opposed to their [Flanderized](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) versions from later.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCheck

-   *Remake*:Tifa's a Damager, Aerith's a Healer/Mage, and Barret's a Tank. Cloud is [whatever's best in the current situation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades) - normally acting as a Damager/Tank but can also function as a healer in a pinch.
-   *Rebirth*: In addition to the above, *Rebirth* adds Yuffie as a Damager, Cait Sith as a Healer/Mage, and Red XIII as a Tank.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Dream Team,0," [Dream Team](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam): The party is made of a top rank [Super-Soldier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier), a human weapons platform, one of the finest martial artists in the world, the greatest sorceress in the world and a legendary beast. It's no wonder, it took less than half the party to become Midgar's gladiatorial champions.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamTeam
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Dysfunction Junction,0, [Dysfunction Junction](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction): This is not a well adjusted team. Says something that the one with most of their problems squared away is the [Last of Her Kind](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHerKind) former lab project orphan Aerith. And she is only that because she is a [Stepford Smiler](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler).,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Everyone Has Standards,0," [Everyone Has Standards](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards): They all have a bone to pick with Shinra for one reason or another, but they're very much trying to be moral and proper about it, even when [Revenge](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge) is the motivation. Seeing anyone else go a bit too far tends to invoke a [What the Hell, Hero?](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero) claim, especially towards Cloud's more [Jerkass](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass) tendencies.  (SPOILER) This gets upped in *Rebirth* when Sephiroth starts blatantly taking over his mind, and Cloud mercilessly murders the hell out of Shinra troops before the group's horrified eyes. ",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,"Fighter, Mage, Thief",0," [Fighter, Mage, Thief](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief): Cloud, Aerith and Tifa respectively.<ul>
-   Cloud, being a strong physical attacker with a heavy sword and being capable of switching to Punisher Mode, which gives him even more power at the cost of speed, is the Fighter.
-   Tifa is the Thief. Her playstyle is based on Japanese kempo martial arts and makes her a low-defense and quick-hitting Thief-Fighter hybrid much closer to the former than to the latter. She can run very fast, pull off long but not very powerful combos of quick punches and kicks, even in the air, and dodge most enemy attacks easily. Equipping her with the Steal Materia, Materia that boost evasion, speed and Luck and status-inflicting spells turns her into a full Thief.
-   Aerith is the Mage, because her playstyle revolves entirely around magic: she has the best Magic and Spirit growths, her abilities are all magic-based (including normal attacks) and she's the most suited character to being the party's healer and caster.
-   Barret doesn't fall squarely in any category, but could count as a bulky [Magic Knight](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight) that leans more heavily on the Fighter side (especially if equipped with melee weapons), as he has long-range attacks and decent magic but a strong build more focused on tanking physical hits.
-   The new characters in *Rebirth* also have this dynamic. Red is the Fighter, using up close claw and spinning strikes with a vengeance style built up with damage. Yuffie is the Mage, much of her gameplay is centered on her ninjitsu empowering physical attacks and making puppet doppelgangers. Cait is the Thief, an unusual cat/giant moogle fighter who changes stances to keep those around him off guard.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Fire-Forged Friends,0," [Fire-Forged Friends](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends): Barret and Cloud are a classic case. Initially hostile towards each other due to their different temperaments, they nevertheless make a good team. As the story progresses the two men gradually start to develop a camaraderie, learning that they can count on each other in a fight. By the end of part 1, they've formed a solid friendship, though they still get on each other's nerves.

-   Cloud - Melancholic (introverted and initially standoffish, aloof and apathetic).
-   Barret - Choleric (angry, boisterous and short-tempered).
-   Tifa - Phlegmatic (kind, empathetic and a bit shy).
-   Aerith - Sanguine (a [Nice Girl](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl) like Tifa, but more outgoing and eternally playful).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Gender-Equal Ensemble,1," [Gender-Equal Ensemble](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble): Played straight in *Remake* since Red XIII isn't a controllable party member, which leaves the playable party with two men and women. Gradually subverted come the second part, for while it temporarily becomes equal when Yuffie joins the group, it tilts towards the men once Cait Sith also joins and stays unbalanced from then on, with Cid and Vincent also joining, and  (SPOILER) one of the women leaves at the end of *Rebirth*, turning it into a group with two women and six men .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderEqualEnsemble
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Hero with Bad Publicity,0," [Hero with Bad Publicity](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity): Shinra goes above and beyond to demonize them as much as possible. First, when  (SPOILER) Jessie's bomb initially just wrecked the base core, they destroy the entire reactor as part of a [False Flag Operation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation) . It all climaxes when they attack Mako Reactor 5, where  (SPOILER) Shinra writes them off as pawns acting against Midgar under Wutai's orders .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,General,General,Love Triangle,0," [Love Triangle](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle): Suffice to say that the (in)famous love triangle between Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa has been brought back for this game. There are plenty of [Ship Tease](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease) moments between Cloud and the two ladies; some sweet, some funny, some sad, all memorable. The player has dialogue options this time around to make Cloud seem slightly more attracted to either of them, as well as show some interest in Jessie.

Subverted, as Barret and Aerith are playable simultaneously (but not in the party alongside Cloud) for a single boss battle  (SPOILER) after Cloud faces Rufus on the rooftop of Shinra HQ . The trope is avoided  (SPOILER) should Aerith and Barret be the ones to come to Cloud's aid in the final boss fight against Sephiroth,  and also during Chapter 17's Hard Mode-exclusive combat simulations with Chadley, where Aerith and Barret are both available to use for three-person battles.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers

Several times the group is saved from certain death, twice during the end chase sequence when Barret misses the bombs with his [Arm Cannon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon) and again when Cloud would've accidentally killed the whole gang with a helicopter. This even extends to bringing them back from the dead if it has to, such as reviving Barret after Sephiroth fatally stabs him at the chest, and possibly resurrecting Cloud after he smashed into the ground falling from the reactor into Aerith's flower patch.

With this new element, Cloud spends a large part of *Rebirth* wondering if he is starting to experience this degradation, as he starts coming into conflict over the fact that he knows things he shouldn't know and doesn't know things he should know, experiences frequent headaches, and starts to be affected more and more by Sephiroth's influence, leading him to do and believe things he wouldn't in his sane mind.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAngstUpgrade

Granted, he couldn't do much to Sephiroth in the end, but even that level of struggle would be out of his original self's league.

But in *Remake*, when [Johnny](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey) gets captured by Shinra security for questioning and [ratting out Jessie](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseLips), which could jeopardize the whole group, Cloud immediately jumps to wanting to kill Johnny - which horrifies Tifa and causes her to plead for him to back down. Notably, unlike in the original where Barret rehires Cloud for the next mission, Cloud's bad attitude leads Barret to choose not to rehire him for the Sector 5 mako reactor job, forcing the Arbiters of Fate to intercede, and the people who hire him for side-quests often berate him lacking altruism.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Adaptational Nice Guy,0," [Adaptational Nice Guy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy): He's a bit less abrasive in the early part of *Remake* than he was in the original. Instead of arguing with Barret over money, he agrees to help Tifa out with the filters in exchange for the rest of his payment for the Sector 7 job, and doesn't ask for more money than he'd originally been promised. *Rebirth*  (SPOILER) removes a scene of him attacking Aerith in anger and confusion, but otherwise fully conscious of his actions, after giving the Black Materia to Sephiroth and instead changes it to him trying to save her from Sephiroth. The one time he does attack a friend, Tifa, it was under mako induced delirium .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy

While Cloud is still depicted as good-looking with a lean yet muscular physique, he now has very pale skin, lines, and slight discoloration under his eyes. It results in enough of a stressed, sleep-deprived appearance that his landlady, Marle, will ask more than once if he is getting enough rest.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalUgliness
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Afraid of Needles,0," [Afraid of Needles](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles): Cloud isn't fond of needles.

It's even a recurring theme in his relationship with them since he made a [Declaration of Protection](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeclarationOfProtection) with both women: The [promise to help Tifa when they were children](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise) and being ""hired"" as Aerith's bodyguard when they first met.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Amnesiac Hero,0," [Amnesiac Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero): By his own admission in *Rebirth*, he has no memory of what happened between him and Sephiroth during their confrontation in the Mako Reactor, and when Tifa attempts to ask him what he has been doing in the 5 years since that happened, he admits he can't tell her.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero

He demonstrates his protectiveness early when he moves to kill Johnny to silence any potential information leaks that could hurt Tifa.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,The Artifact,0," [The Artifact](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact): Despite certain *Final Fantasy* series (and other certain JRPG franchises) having switched to more realistic hairstyles for their protagonists (compare him to Noctis from *[Final Fantasy XV](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV)*, Yuri Lowell from *Tales of Vesperia*, or Joker from *Persona 5*), Cloud still retains his gravity-defying spikes because they’re one of his many iconic traits (and will likely remain that way).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact

He became a SOLDIER First Class so he could be just like Sephiroth, whom he idolized when he was a child back in Nibelheim, but he's about as far from a [Fanboy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanboy) of Sephiroth as he can get by now, with Sephiroth being a massive [Broken Pedestal](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal) to Cloud due to the [Nibelheim Incident](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Attention Whore,0," [Attention Whore](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore): Downplayed; it isn't a prominent aspect of his character, but Cloud likes receiving praise and adoration from others, and part of the reason for his ""cold, professional badass"" attitude is to make people take him seriously and respect him. *Rebirth* calls attention to this with Biggs, who directly says he's trying to impress people acting this way. On other occasions when Cloud is the center of attention, such as leading the Seventh Infantry at Junon or fighting Dio at the Gold Saucer, he's caught off-guard when he gets praised for his performance, but once it sinks in what's happening he smiles and eagerly enjoys the moment.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore

When Cloud makes his way through the streets, several  NPCs  talk about how hot Cloud is or openly flirt with him. Talking to Chadley when Cloud's in a dress reduces Chadley to a blushing, stammering mess. Even Cloud acknowledges he makes a hot girl, telling Tifa he 'nailed it'.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender

-   The size of Cloud's [BFS](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS) becomes a problem at a few points. When Cloud first investigates the apartment next to him, he tries to draw his Buster Sword against an apparition of Sephiroth. Given that Cloud's standing in the doorway, his sword ends up hitting the door frame. Also, when Cloud rests, he has to either completely remove his sword or tilt it out of the way so he can sit down.
-   Cloud's Nail Bat weapon gives fantastic increases to critical hits. Unfortunately, it has poor stats all-around and in [Punisher Mode](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem), it's the only weapon not to have a combo. Instead, Cloud will do a single strike (though this can send an enemy flying back).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical

He drives a bike twice in *Remake*, and ends up destroying a bunch of Shinra bikes, a truck, and even duels Roche while both are riding their bikes. Some of Cloud's dialogue indicates that this is a standard for members of SOLDIER. In Chapters 17 and 18 of *Remake* he pulls some insane stunts with his motorcycle that go far beyond he did in the original game or even in *Advent Children.*",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Bash Brothers,0," [Bash Brothers](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers): In spite of their differences, Cloud and Barret work very well together in a fight. They even strike a [Back-to-Back Badasses](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses) pose at one point. In *Rebirth*, he's also this with  (SPOILER) Zack when they team up against Sephiroth at the end of the game .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Batter Up!,0," [Batter Up!](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp): A weapon he can obtain from the kids at the Leaf House is a baseball bat covered in tape and nails.

He can even imbue the ""[Berserk](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEdgedBuff)"" status effect on himself naturally in Punisher mode by charging his attack, but it will only last a few seconds.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker

While he isn't a ""knight"" in the traditional sense, he shares a lot in common with the Dark Knights of previous *[Final Fantasy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy)* games and can be considered an adjacent to them. Cloud doesn't particularly use dark magic, but he tends towards dark aesthetics and weaponry, formerly worked for an evil (corporate) empire, is brooding and introspective, and struggles with his sense of self — all traits of Final Fantasy Dark Knights.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight

-   *Rebirth* adds him the ability to attack enemies with several weak blade beams, to make air combat more manageable for him.
-   His [Synergy ability with Aerith](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack), Firework Blade, involves Aerith casting magic on Cloud's [BFS](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS) to turn it into a [Spell Blade](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellBlade), which he then unleashes with several ranged blade slashes before they both finish off their enemies with a [Sword Beam](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam) and [fireball](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fireballs) combo.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeSpam

He's an elite [Super-Soldier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier), can beat veteran bodybuilders in squatting competitions, is a [Badass Biker](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker), and performs some truly spectacular dance moves in Wall Market and at the Gold Saucer. *Rebirth* also adds the ability to play a piano, skill at both formation marching and drilling troops, a top chocobo jockey, and an expert Queen's Blood player.

-   ""Not interested."" Cloud's cool and aloof nature leads to him pushing people away when they try to get close to him. He says a lot of lines similar to ""not interested"" when they do, but that exact wording is the most consistent way he says it.
-   ""*Ex*-SOLDIER."" Several people identify Cloud as a SOLDIER due to the mako infusion in his eyes. Cloud becomes a minor [Phrase Catcher](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhraseCatcher) with ""Are you in SOLDIER?"" from a lot of people, though Cloud is [quite quick to correct them](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology) that he quit. Even his default outfit is labelled at ""Ex-SOLDIER: First Class"" in the Costa del Sol changing booths.

However, it's gradually shown in *Rebirth* that while he's like that to Avalanche, he doesn't share the same level of consideration towards strangers and usually needs to be egged on by someone to accept a job.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Chick Magnet,0," [Chick Magnet](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet): Even more so than the original game.

According to her recollection, they grew up in the same small town and used to play together before Thea Lockhart's death, of which afterwards they didn't hang out as much, shown in Cloud ignoring Tifa who calls out to him and keeps walking in a flashback.

In his case, it's less that he feels responsible for everything and more along the lines of the whole scenario where someone is forced to do underpaid work in the hope of building enough of a rep to start a proper business - he is rude to everyone asking him to help them and complains about the menial quality of the work almost the whole time.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome

He even spreads the syndrome to people around him, with young people in Sector 7 rushing out to buy ""big-ass swords"" and imitating his rude mannerisms, and the children of Sector 5 making homemade Buster Swords. By *Rebirth*, the rest of the main characters have all seen through Cloud's exterior to know that he's a [Jerk with a Heart of Gold](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold), but let him keep up the act because he's [The Ace](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce) of their group and because they know what a good person he is on the inside.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou

He clearly has memory problems and some unknown (to the others chracters) mental issues, but he *was* [SOLDIER](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier) and has worked for Shinra for years, which makes him the more experienced of the group compared to Tifa (who is a great martial artist, but very much not an actual military person), Barett (impulsive self-taught terrorist leader), Aerith (flower girl and [White Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage)) and Red XIII (escaped lab experiment).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot

It even triggers unique interactions during his [Duel Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss) with Rufus and Darkstar in *Remake*.

He also never misses a chance to point out that he wasn't *just* a SOLDIER; he was a First Class. In other words, he comes off as someone who desperately clings to the parts of his identity he's proud of, and isn't at all confident in himself otherwise, trying to use his title in place of his lack of social graces. Unfortunately for him, this is  (SPOILER) one of the strings Sephiroth is most easily able to pull, as Cloud's need for validation is so strong that he will consider even the most outlandish words at least a little.

He can also deal a fair amount of magic damage but not as high as Aerith who possesses a very high Magic Attack. Despite all that, Cloud does have his [Stance System](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem) which allows him to switch between [Force and Finesse](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceAndFinesse) on the fly, thus enabling him to stay on the playing field. By using different weapons, Cloud can also focus on certain areas, allowing him to fill any role in the party. He won't be *the best* at many of these, but he's an extremely versatile party member.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Jerk with a Heart of Gold,0," [Jerk with a Heart of Gold](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold): His [lack of social graces](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills) and insistence that he's [Only in It for the Money](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney) make him come off as particularly abrasive, but he'll always turn around to do the right thing, even if he has to make up an excuse for it. He also softens up noticeably from spending time with Tifa, Jessie, and Aerith. *Rebirth* allows the player to play up the ""Heart of Gold"" aspect depending on dialogue choices, especially around Aerith and Tifa, and to a lesser extent Barret and the other party members. Cloud being, well, *[Cloud](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero)*, he can still easily put his foot in his mouth, but at other times he can be surprisingly tactful and encouraging, displaying a great deal of empathy. Even when unsuccessful, there are multiple occasions where his teammates appreciate the fact that he tries.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Lethal Joke Weapon,0," [Lethal Joke Weapon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon): The Nail Bat has poor stats all-around, but its [Batter Up!](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp) unique heavy attack is very effective against enemy types that go into a pressured state after a certain damage threshold. Because it's the strongest single non-ability hit in the game, it can stun-lock them over and over until staggered. This can turn certain fights like Fat Chocobo into a complete joke.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Lightning Bruiser,0," [Lightning Bruiser](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser): He's fast, strong, and can take quite a lot of punishment before going down. This is best showcased [in the cutscenes](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax), particularly  (SPOILER) the one before the final battle with Sephiroth in *Remake*, where he acrobatically leaps through the collapsing ruins of a skyscraper and effortlessly cleaves through massive chunks of rubble a la *Advent Children* .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser

As the closest connection to their shared childhood, he is somebody she needs to keep going and to live for. This is best shown when Tifa  (SPOILER) falls into the Lifestream in *Rebirth*, where she is bombarded with memories of their lives together and she pleads to Cloud that she needs him, and that her greatest fear is losing him to Sephiroth .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch

Cloud attacks deal much more damage here than in Operator Mode, both in terms of raw damage and the number of hits per attack. In addition, guarding in Punisher Mode makes him [counter enemy melee attacks](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack), he's harder to stagger, and he takes slightly less damage. As a trade-off, Cloud's speed plummets to a crawl, and he can't block long-range attacks anymore. A combat roll will also take him back to Operator Mode so that it can't be used as a movement option.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Momma's Boy,0," [Momma's Boy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy): He was raised as a single child by a single mother, so she means an awful lot to him. This is also shown in Cloud's personality where he has a lot of social issues from not having a strong male figure in his life such as his inferiority complex. It also makes him  (SPOILER) spontaneously both susceptible and resistant to Sephiroth's manipulations. He quite easily can be manipulated to refer to Jenova as a ""mother"", but, unlike the other Sephiroth clones, he is always reminded of his actual mother when Sephiroth appears to him personally. Sephiroth has to resort to mocking Cloud about Claudia's death to manipulate him instead .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy

Even [In-Universe](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse) several characters tend to pine or lust after him.

-   When Johnny rats out Jessie after being captured by Shinra security, Cloud is perfectly willing to kill him to stop Johnny from jeopardizing all of Avalanche. When Tifa objects, Cloud settles for just telling Johnny to leave Midgar and never come back.
-   At the Temple of the Ancients, Cloud stops holding back and kills the wounded soldiers and tries to kill the Turks after their battle. It gets so bad Tifa has to give him a [Cooldown Hug](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownHug) to spare them and get them back on track.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution

Cloud does have an athletic, muscular physique, but on the lean side of things, built around endurance and stamina instead of raw strength, which is how real-life soldiers are supposed to be. He technically lacks the size and bulk necessary to be able to swing around the Buster Sword the way he does, let alone heft it. [Justified](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope) by the fact that he has gained [Super-Strength](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength) from being subjected to advanced [Super-Soldier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier) experimentation.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless

Once Cloud comes to, he's horrified by what he did and shouts her name in grief thinking he killed her. Once she's safely returned by the Weapon, he takes it upon himself to watch over her until she recovers .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Mysterious Past,0," [Mysterious Past](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast): Cloud's past is one of the biggest mysteries in *Remake*, and it stays that way for all of Part 1 due to Cloud's standoffish personality. All that the player is told for certain is that he grew up in the same town as Tifa, but he left at some point to join SOLDIER. Whatever happened in the years since then he refuses to elaborate on, but it's clear that *something* (or several *somethings*) occurred that made him leave Shinra... and left a few scars on his psyche.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,No Social Skills,0," [No Social Skills](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills): He is rather awkward around others. He tries to put up a cool and disinterested front to hide this, but most people see right through it. Aerith in particular has a lot of fun teasing him about it. That said, he is making a genuine effort to try to be more open with others as of *Rebirth* and feels bad over his lack of communication, particularly with his party members.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Not in This for Your Revolution,0," [Not in This for Your Revolution](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution): The words [""not interested""](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCatchphrase) are tied with him for a reason. Cloud makes it clear to Barret that he is only working with them for money and is not a full-blown supporter of Avalanche's cause.

-   During the opening bombing mission, Cloud keeps any and all banter to a minimum with the other members of Avalanche. As time goes on, however, he begins to joke with them more and even smiles at their antics.
-   While he is very much not interested in the shenanigans of Wall Market, he absolutely will kill it on the dance floor when required to. And he knows he pulled off that dress.
QUOTE **Cloud:** Nailed it, I know. Thank you. Moving on.

-   When he gets turned into a Moogle by the Moogle Merchant in *Rebirth*, he actually has fun with it and even adds ""Kupo"" to the end of his sentence when asked if he enjoyed it.
-   If he's accompanied by Aerith during their first visit at the Gold Saucer, he plays along with her when she pretends to be a race caller at the Chocobo Square.
QUOTE **Aerith:** This is some kinda race today, folks. In all my years in the booth, only seen couple this close! So, Cloud, which bird do you think is gonna take home the win?

QUOTE **Cloud:** Well, Aerith, considering their plumage and breeding, I think the choice is clear.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Not So Stoic,0," [Not So Stoic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic): Cloud attempts to maintain an air of disinterest or aloofness as often as he can. He only truly loses his cool when Sephiroth shows up.<ul>
-   Cloud encountering Sephiroth after the reactor bombing causes Cloud to [deny what he's seeing is real](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe), especially since Cloud says that he killed Sephiroth with his own hands. When Sephiroth insults Cloud's mother and reminds Cloud that he killed her, Cloud screams ""You bastard!"" and goes for an overhead swing. When it's revealed to be all just an illusion, Cloud quickly pulls himself together.
-   When he encounters Sephiroth in Hojo's laboratory, Cloud completely loses it, screams at the top his lungs, and charges Sephiroth in a blind panic.
-   While he's normally brusque with Yuffie, it's shown with his interactions he can act like the aloof big brother who occasionally plays along with her childish antics. Their ""date"" at the Gold Saucer is a big example of this.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII_Remake/,Final Fantasy VII Remake,Cloud,Cloud Strife,Only in It for the Money,0," [Only in It for the Money](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney): If Cloud's being paid to do a job, he'll do it to the best of his ability, but that's as far as the relationship between him and anyone who hires him goes. Much like in the original game, he gradually grows out of this as Cloud finds reasons to fight other than money.<ul>
-   As Cloud makes clear multiple times throughout the opening bombing mission, [he's ""not interested"" in anything that Avalanche plans to do or why they're doing it](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution). He's only there because he's been promised money for it. This attitude initially gets him cut from the Sector 5 bombing mission, forcing the Arbiters of Fate to intercede by injuring Jessie so that Cloud has to fill in for her.
-   On completing a few sidequests, an NPC might casually ask him to do something else, only for Cloud to ask for more money to do it. Notably, after visiting a woman's grave to pay respects in her husband's stead, Cloud tells the old man to bring the graveyard's key back to the kid Cloud bought it from. The old man asks Cloud to do it for him, but Cloud says it'll cost five thousand Gil to do it. The old man immediately grumbles about how stingy Cloud is being.
-   Even when a group of Leaf House orphans asks Cloud to defeat a ""toad king"" that's been kidnapping them, Cloud still charges the kids money to rescue the others. However, Cloud tells the kids he's ""running a special on toad king jobs"" when they ask this of him, [and only charges the kids three gil](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold).
-   Later on, he doesn't quibble too much about Aerith teasing that she'll pay him with 'one date' for helping her escape Reno and Shinra from the Turks. The number of sidequests both she and other characters rope Cloud into further cement his [Defrosting Ice King](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceKing) persona.
-   When  (SPOILER)  the plate collapse crushes Seventh Heaven, Barret and Tifa briefly discuss rebuilding it . When Tifa asks if Cloud will help, he quips 'for the right price', which comes off more like an in-joke at this point, since he and the group are becoming [True Companions](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions) at this point in the game.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney

-    (SPOILER)  When going through the Temple of the Ancients, Cloud becomes noticeably colder and obsessed with reaching the Black Materia. He cuts down a SOLDIER pleading for his life without any hesitation, callously shrugs off an emotional pep talk from Aerith, and can be heard [quietly chuckling](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad) during the fight with the Demon Walls.

There's also his iconic [Victory Pose](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryPose) where he [casually twirls his huge blade with one arm](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponTwirling).

-   Cloud may be blunt and sarcastic, but other times when he tries to be genuine he can be incredibly tactless. His interactions with his party members showcase this throughout *Remake* and *Rebirth*, because he's a socially awkward young man with zero experience in relationships with the occasionally charming responses,  (SPOILER) and lost five formative years of development , he has a lot of difficulty expressing his true feelings. Probably the best example of this is a disparaging comment he makes about Zack to Aerith while the team is in Gongaga, referring to him as a ""loser"" for not keeping in touch with Aerith or having the decency to end their relationship to allow her to move on  <sup>note </sup>  Aerith suspects Zack is dead but has no knowledge of what happened. Meanwhile, Cloud has severe memory issues and at this point doesn't remember Zack or the circumstances of his death ; while *meant* well, it's an extremely tactless and inappropriate comment for the situation.
-   Another example in Junon: while conversing with Tifa, she picks up on his lack of interest in the topic she's reminiscing about, and he admits he isn't. He quickly realises how this sounds and expresses a genuine willingness to listen anyway, but Tifa is naturally hurt and doesn't want to continue.

But because he lacks the bigger context to Jenova's cells being in him or all SOLDIER, never mind *why* Sephiroth is able to mess with and control him, he thinks it's entirely because of SOLDIER cell degradation like with Broden, only a short distance from the truth.

-   His physical capabilities also seem to change depending on the scene. During the raid on the reactor at the very beginning of the game, at one point the catwalk Cloud is on collapses and he's able to jump up about 6 feet to safety without any issue, but later on when a bridge collapses beneath him again, he isn't able to jump nearly as far and only avoids falling because Aerith sticks out her staff for him to grab onto.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe

As the game progresses, Cloud shows his more heroic traits, as well as genuine emotion. He can even be quite gentle, such as when he holds Biggs' hand after the latter receives mortal injuries, and based on three optional scenes, either gets into a heart-to-heart talk with Barret (where they bury their past animosity), embraces Tifa when she cries, or comforts Aerith when she visits him in his dream.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality

This comes after spending a whole day being stand-offish and abrasive with the team, showing he cares more about them than he lets on.

Here, he is far more pleasant and openly affectionate with them. He also intended for them to simply sabotage Reactor 7's Mako pump, rather than blow up the whole reactor like in the original.
-   While Barret and Cloud's relationship also changes from hostile to friendly like in the original game, *Rebirth* expands on it by having Barret become more of a fatherly figure to Cloud over time, especially if he's taken as Cloud's ""date"" at the Gold Saucer.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy

At different points in the game, both Cloud and Tifa have to stop him from picking fights with ordinary civilians simply for vocally supporting Shinra or repeating anti-Avalanche propaganda.

He's so resentful of Shinra, that instead of snarking at you if you're going the wrong direction like normal - if he realizes you're going to loot Shinra treasure (like stealing Airbuster's equipment or going for the materia in Reactor 5) he'll be happy to go along.

In *Remake*, she's unsure of herself and often wonders if the group's actions are justifiable.
-   In the original game, Barret and the others had no reason to question Tifa's resolve, but her reluctance to hurt innocents with Avalanche's bombing plan in the Remake causes Jessie to wonder whether Tifa is truly committed to their cause. During the trip to Mako Reactor 5, she also admits to being nervous, something she never truly expressed in the original game.
-   She's also alot more torn up about the destruction of her bar, alongside the rest of Sector 7. In the original she's sad about the loss of life but shows no real grief about losing her bar. Whereas in the remake losing her bar makes the entire situation all the more painful. Losing the bar reignites feelings of loss when she lost her family and hometown years ago, making her breakdown in Cloud's arms.</ul>

Once an enemy is downed, her ability to increase Stagger Damage the fastest among the playable cast allows her to rack up heavy burst damage against foes in very little time. With proper gear and execution, Tifa can be considered the most effective attack character, gameplay-wise. Her lack of strong defensive options means that she'll be taking as much damage as she deals out. Of the three fighters, she doesn't naturally have an ability to help her tank a hit, even though she does have super armor on a few moves to help push through the damage.

Cloud can even describe her as being ""good with the books"" to Chocobo Sam. *[Final Fantasy VII Remake: Trace of Two Pasts](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FinalFantasyVIIRemakeTraceOfTwoPasts)* shows this even more prominently, as Tifa personalizes the workout routine of the people in her Calisthenics group in Nibelheim, gets good at counting money to pay off her medical bills during her time at the slums and even figures out how to get more work done for her food stand so that she can raise the money years before she first figured.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWithNumbers

No matter how many hardships she experienced and tragedies she has to endure, she'd always put others before herself, regardless of who they are, and goes out of her way to help them as best as she can even to her own detriment without asking for anything in return, not wanting anyone to suffer like she did.

In *Rebirth*  (SPOILER) Sephiroth capitalizes on this and increases the divide between the two by gaslighting Cloud into thinking she is an imposter and nearly killing her.

Her damage dealing at base is the weakest of the group and her frailty can quickly become a liability. Many players pass her up for Cloud's greater base damage and tanking or Barret and Aerith's long-distance prowess.

(SPOILER)  During the Nibelheim Incident Cloud mentions finding Tifa lying on the ground, seemingly dead, after she attacked Sephiroth at the mako reactor. Sephiroth takes advantage of this by gaslighting Cloud into thinking the real Tifa is dead and that the Tifa traveling with the party is a [Jenova offshoot impersonating her](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation).

Aside from having a more reasonable figure, her outfit is designed to avoid (quote) ""Unnatural movement"" and [preserve her modesty](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyShorts), while also having a fighting style that looks more like martial arts and less like gymnastics. The overall effect is to, once again, putting the focus on the strong characterization that she displayed back in the original game. On the other hand, her mature dress during the Wall Market segment shows a lot more skin, trading the [Cleavage Window](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleavageWindow) in favor of an [Impossibly-Low Neckline](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyLowNeckline) and [Sideboob](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sideboob).

She's also very dedicated to creating the most positive and communal environment possible within Sector Seven.

However, the games also deconstruct this and show what is nice and what is necessary aren't always the same thing, and that part of her niceness is a codependency streak she has a hard time without. In *Remake* she avoids keeping her actual feelings about the Mako Reactor job so not to dour everyone's mood, and as a result of their activity Shinra has all the evidence they need to drop a plate while putting the blame on Avalanche. *Rebirth* explores a more flawed side to her, namely her need to be liked by everyone that sometimes comes at the expense of her better judgment, and in the past, even led to her  (SPOILER) throwing one person under the bus because it was the village's popular opinion to cast fault on that person for things they didn't actually do: Cloud himself, who saved Tifa's life when she tried to climb Mt.

Tifa is aware of this personality flaw, admits that she hates it about herself, and is determined to be better .

Knowing that Sephiroth and the Whispers would fail to notice what she's really up to until she makes her critical move, Aerith summons the ""main"" beagle-Stamp timeline Cloud to her realm at a precise moment to give him the now fully powered materia just before Sephiroth arrives to kill her, gambling her hopes onto Cloud successfully delivering this materia, in turn, to his timeline's Aerith to replace her non-functioning materia, which he does upon meeting the other Aerith in the Sleeping Forest. Though the exact details aren't revealed, this seems to give Aerith access to even greater power than she had before, allowing her to control or at least work alongside her own version of the Whispers (represented by their white coloring), which may or may not have played a role in her continuing to exist in some form, if not outright surviving, Sephiroth's blade when he comes to kill her again at the story's climax .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit

However, in *Rebirth* it's revealed that the Whispers stripped this knowledge from her and Red XIII as punishment for defying them.

Completing all of them has her don a flowing long and red dress (reimagined from the one she wore for the same part of the original story), complete with a cutscene hammering home her beauty and Cloud's subsequent shock.

In addition, she's a [Long-Range Fighter](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter), casting magical bolts from her staff. At the same time, Aerith has the lowest max HP and Defense among the party, her Magic Defense is sub-par, and her attacks are relatively weak and slow. Her evasion is also poor, compared to Tifa who can't take a hit well either, but is very good at *avoiding* being hit.

She also doesn't have a very high opinion of herself at all, confessing to Cloud that she always gives up on everything.  (SPOILER) Not to mention it's heavily implied she somehow knows how the events of the original game are supposed to go, up to and including her fated death at Sephiroth's hands.

Her attempt to cover the slip by saying she guessed based on his sword comes off as an awkward lie, though how she knew he was a merc is left unexplained.

He also uses his natural voice when discussing the Whispers with Aerith at the inn, a sign of their [Commonality Connection](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonalityConnection) and that he trusts her.

It's more accurate to say he's *extremely careful* of who he allows to touch and pet him, and even then he's tense and guarded. Touching his paw pads, on the other hand, is completely and utterly out of the question. No matter how much Aerith pokes, prods and begs to touch them, he refuses to budge on this. Even the offer of a foot massage from her doesn't work.

While disguised as a Shinra trooper, Red takes full advantage of the flamboyant nature of dance to maintain the illusion that he's bipedal as he struts, spins, and moonwalks his way through a crowd of spectators to challenge Cloud to a card battle.

But once he arrives home to Cosmo Canyon, Red drops the stoicism and acts like an outgoing, excitable teenager. He explains that he lowers his voice and acts aloof while trying to be taken seriously rather than being treated like a dog.

His unique abilities also include a full spread of physical and magical attacks, plus buffs and healing.

(SPOILER) As Aerith had knowledge of the original Compilation at the time, and she herself recognises Jenova, whatever she did to calm Red also gave him some of that foreknowledge.

-   He likes to give the impression of an old, wise and knowledgeable man but also seems unable to resist snarking at others' expense, particularly Barret's. Makes sense, as he's actually a teenager by the standards of his species, and is merely *sounding* more mature than he really is.
-   He tries to sign up for the Queen's Blood tournament aboard the Shinra-8, and is angry with the clerk when they reject him because only humans are permitted to play. Red then resorts to dressing up like a Shinra trooper and walking on his hind legs so he can pass as human and challenge Cloud, and he even spins and moonwalks to prove that pretending to be bipedal isn't so difficult. In the late game when the party pays their second visit to the Gold Saucer and split off to visit the attractions, Red can be found at the Queen's Blood arena in the Wonder Square ready to play Cloud again, this time without a disguise.
-   He's noticeably flustered when Aerith and Tifa ask for his opinion on their beachwear, so much so that he momentarily slips into his natural voice. He then gives them very awkwardly worded [Purple Prose](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse) compliments to try and recover, and when the girls are confused, he claims that [human standards of beauty are difficult for him to judge](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial).
-   He's not above mooching food off of people like a pet would. He actually identifies his appetite as his [Fatal Flaw](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw); he loses focus very easily if he notices food. He's also often seen to draw awe from children whenever the party visits a new town and splits up to see the sights, and while he claims to the party that it annoys him, it's more subtly implied that he likes the attention.
-   When the group arrives at the Gold Saucer, they put to vote who wants to have fun in the park. Aerith, Tifa, and Yuffie are ecstatic to say yes, while Red hesitates before sheepishly saying yes as well. He wastes no time in joining them, however.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll

The result is that while her physical capabilities are impressive, she makes poor decisions and is easily tricked and outsmarted by her enemies. It takes a lot of support from Avalanche for her to get inside the Shinra building, she and Sonon are noticed almost immediately and things quickly go south from there, and it's only with Sonon's help that she's able to make it out alive. If she had been left on her own, Yuffie likely would have gotten herself captured within hours of arriving at Midgar purely because of her immaturity and inexperience.

However, these are necessary tools because she's the sole playable character in the DLC, so she has to be prepared to take on any type of enemy regardless of the player's set-up for her, and she needs more safety nets to avoid being killed because the player can't just switch control to an ally and revive her.

-   Compared to their [Disc-One Final Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss) status in the original game Shinra has a far more prominent role in *Remake* and their overall competence and threat level is much higher. Individual characters such as Rufus, Scarlet, Reno and Rude are significantly more dangerous than they were in the original game and Shinra collectively poses a much greater challenge to the heroes [until Sephiroth arrives](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish).
-   In the original game, its implied that outside of Wutai, Shinra's conquest of the planet was relatively peaceful and achieved through benign socio-economic factors, namely that their mako reactors generated cheap electricity that gradually made everyone dependent on Shinra to live. Expanded worldbuilding in *Rebirth* explains that before Shinra's rise to power, there were regional governments in places like Kalm and Junon, and Shinra went to war with and conquered them despite ""just"" being a weapons manufacturer and power company.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass

Along with their actions from the original,  (SPOILER)  such as the dropping of the Sector 7 Plate and killing thousands in the process  they also intentionally destroy Reactor 1 when Avalanche's bomb merely disables it, causing great deals of destruction and causing mass panic in order to [make the group come off as](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity) [Bomb-Throwing Anarchists](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchists) instead of [Well-Intentioned Extremists](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist). Their motivations behind these actions, which in the original can be seen as them simply going overboard in their attempts to stamp out Avalanche, are also considerably worse, with them framing Avalanche as being allies with Wutai so they can have an excuse to launch another war against them and ignite the populace of Midgar to support their efforts, which knowing them [is likely so they can make more Gil.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit)  (SPOILER)  There's also the fact that the reason for their poor running of the Midgar is less out of genuine idiocy (probably) and more so because they plan to *abandon Midgar and everyone in it* so they can build a newer, bigger city in the Promised Land. 
-   In *Rebirth* a big piece of the worldbuilding is the wars Shinra led against the Kalm and Junon republics to conquer them. Wars recent enough that you meet veterans of said wars and they are all middle-aged. In the original game, though there's precious little about the world geopolitics (to the point where it's not clear if there are any other nations outside Wutai, or if the world is just a collection of villages and towns) and history, outside of the Wutai war and Shinra's various operations against insurgencies and AVALANCHE there's no real indication that Shinra's take over the world was particularly violent. What we do learn, about the origin of Midgar and Barret's own backstory, implies it was anything but - Shinra's economic might basically rendered local governments impotent (As it did mayor Domino) or obsolete as towns welcomed Shinra for the economic benefits and the promises Mako brought.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy

While this is natural to expect in Midgar, the city they built and control, it also goes for the rest of the world — as Cloud points out to Yuffie at one point, Shinra is a huge company with a long history, so logically they'd have hundreds of ex-employees around the world. In turn, this means they have any number of contacts they could get information from, willing or otherwise. Add in their fleet of helicopters and airships that let them mobilize quickly, the intelligence gathering skills of the Turks, and the number of Shinra facilities around the world that they still monitor, and there's very little that Cloud and his allies do on their journey that Shinra is not aware of in part.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching

The crown jewel of Shinra's military is SOLDIER, a [Super-Soldier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier) program that recruits only the best of the best and pickles them in mako to grant them inhuman combat abilities — ostensibly at the cost of having a greatly-decreased life expectancy.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporateWarfare

Shinra ticks all the boxes handily; they run their own city, have their own private army, are ridiculously wealthy and powerful, and their leadership is corrupt and self-serving. However, the business practices that allowed them to become so powerful are shown to be self-destructive — being ruthless, amoral expansionists means they don't care about the problems they cause with their actions, their corporate infrastructure is extremely inefficient, and they're reliant on controlling the masses with propaganda and fearmongering, which only works so far. Finally, their ultimate goal is to  (SPOILER) just become even *more* rich and powerful than they already are, even though they effectively rule the world already, and their plans to achieve this are based on old legends they don't even know are true or not . All in all, Shinra is controlled by short-sighted fools who are making their position even more precarious with their own reckless, pointless greed, and it's dubious if the company is sustainable in the long-term.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction

-    (SPOILER) When Barret saves him from falling to his death off the top of the Shinra headquarters, his demands (when the President had offered him anything he wanted to save him) are to make a public broadcast admitting Shinra were the ones who dropped the Sector 7 plate, and Avalanche is an independent anti-Shinra group with no connections to Wutai. Once he has a gun and feels more confident, the President points out that Barret could have demanded they shut down the mako reactors, but all he asked is for the President to clear their names.

Rufus's introductory speech from the original game about controlling the masses through fear instead of [Bread and Circuses](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses) makes no appearance in this incarnation, with his father absorbing most of that leadership style for himself and leaving the question of how Rufus will run Shinra much more up in the air. Most of his screentime is instead spent on building up his status as a worthy opponent to Cloud. In *Rebirth*, Rufus has his priorities enough in order that he tries cutting a deal with the party to leave each other alone until the much more pressing problem of Sephiroth is dealt with, calls out the board of directors on going along with his father's insane plan to destroy Sector 7, and while he still mistakenly believes that there's a Promised Land for him to find and conquer, Rufus does want to confirm that it actually *exists* before he stakes everything on it.

In addition, his rivalry against Cloud is played up as he goes out of his way to duel the ex-SOLDIER in both *Remake* and *Rebirth*.

Then when Darkstar's HP starts to drop, a cutscene plays where Rufus admits Cloud is giving him a challenge, and he pulls out his first pair of trick coins and shoots them to send a pair of laser blasts at Cloud.

The fact that the Shinra company owns and runs a substantial part of the world emphasizes the similarities between corporate nepotism and hereditary monarchy, with Rufus' position being closer to that of the son of an evil emperor.

However, Rufus wordlessly motions for it to retreat once Cloud's dealt enough damage to it, ensuring Darkstar's continued survival while Rufus now has to face down the ex-SOLDIER all by himself. It's unclear whether he's being empathetic to it or simply pragmatic about fighting with an injured attack dog that they also presumably put a lot of resources into genetically engineering.

If they are willing to go after Sephiroth (which they were already planning on doing) Rufus is willing to look the the other way and stop chasing after them.  The reasoning behind it is pretty simple: it would simply drain too many resources to continually pursue the party and if they can get rid of a much bigger threat to BOTH of them, then they're better off not getting in each others way.

(SPOILER) [He's forced to double-cross them by stealing the key to the Temple of the Ancients](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil), which leaves him devastated when even Aerith condemns him for his betrayal, but makes it up to them by using Cait Sith to buy them time to escape the collapsing Temple .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor

This is ultimately deconstructed, as being the only good person on a board of the most morally bankrupt people in the world results in Reeve's department being perpetually neglected and ignored. As such, Midgar is falling apart in places and the slums are half-buried in literal mountains of junk and scrap. Since he doesn't agree with Shinra's decisions, Reeve himself has about as much power as Midgar's figurehead mayor despite being in an executive position, and he and his entire division are kept as a showpiece to convince the populace that Shinra cares about the city when they obviously don't.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate

-   He always put Aerith's life over seeing her die for his research, if only for the value a living ancient would be and the need Shinra has of her. His dialogue when capturing her with the Glasptropod suggests his desire to study her cellular structure overrides his sense of pragmatism on both accounts.
-   His reason for visiting Costa Del Sol is  (SPOILER) a pretense for him to carry out what is basically a terrorist attack, bringing a Shinra robot with him that unleashes monsters to absorb the black-cloaked figures and terrorize the townsfolk. He also uses this opportunity to try and capture the heroes, not just Aerith, something he never tried to do in the original game.

In the remake continuity the group is *much* larger, with dozens and dozens of victims, and its implied the Nibelheim survivors were just the first batch and Hojo has conducted the same experiments on numerous others in the intervening years.
-   Hojo seemingly has a massively increased body count of victims in other areas, too - in Remake the gang find an underground facility under Midgar that is full of tens of discarded, failed experiments. They are all humanoid - and tanks behind the walls reveal they all used to be people. He also kidnapped children off the streets to be lab assistants before creating Chadley, an android, for his purposes. And even Chadley was not the first - Rebirth reveals he is the seventh in a line of other androids and despite being machines Hojo was still unable to program them to be perfectly loyal, since Chadley escapes and begins to aid the player, something Hojo tries to punish him for. But that's still not all - the Shinra manor is also full of other discarded experiments, not just Vincent; and it's taken further still when Vincent reveals in a sidequest that Hojo's experiments also included the murder of countless people in the combat simulator who died while he was trying to get combat data.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy

This is the first clue that while Hojo may be pretty tech savvy, and an undeniably brilliant biologist, he is quite incompetent outside of his fields of specialized expertise. His lack of ability to understand or empathise with other people also harms his plans - instead of making their stay at Shinra at least bearable, his treatment of Ifalna and a young Aerith led to the two of them escaping, and the experiments were bad enough that Ifalna did not survive long after the escape, costing Hojo and Shinra the last pureblooded Ancient and resulting in them merely observing Aerith from a distance until she got older, likely to avoid a repeat performance of the tragedy.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius

-    (SPOILER)  He starts acting in his own interests and not Shinra's once he realizes Sephiroth is in the building, allowing Sephiroth to do as he pleases up to stealing Jenova and killing the President because he might get some interesting data out of it, being the only one to know that Palmer wasn't just spouting bullshit. He also is likely aware that it is most probably a clone assuming the image of Sephiroth rather than Sephiroth himself, and plays towards his Reunion theory. 
-   His behaviour towards the group runs on similar lines - he could have called for reinforcements to recapture Aerith and kill the others, but instead forced them to run around in his lab defeating specimens so he could get combat data.

In *Remake* the idea that he may be in Shinra tower makes him consider what an offspring of Aerith and Sephiroth would be like. In *Rebirth* his obsession with the genetics of the mutated robed men is implied because he knows that they are almost exactly Sephiroth at the genetic level.

-   In *Rebirth*, the Nibelheim flashback shows the reason Sephiroth and Cloud were dispatched to the mako reactor was due to Hojo tampering with it for an experiment. Given this is the Nibelheim reactor, though, where JENOVA was held, either Hojo deliberately used it for his experiments in the hopes Sephiroth would be deployed there and discover his origins... or he completely failed to care about or consider the possibility. Either way, Sephiroth found the numerous journals about the project left lying around the manor and the destruction of the entire village was the result.
-   In *Rebirth*, the captain of the ship the party is taking to Costa del Sol reaches out to him for assistance  (SPOILER)  with the monsters and robed men threatening his crew and passengers. Hojo more or less tells him they should all prepare to die, even suggesting he mark his own body for later identification. 
-   Later on in *Rebirth* he notes that ""nothing of value"" remains in Shinra Manor. This is despite it being the place where he oversaw the JENOVA Project (i.e. his research partner and wife had his child, Sephiroth, and he also shot Vincent and left him in the basement after experimenting on him). The only thing he says that's remotely sentimental about the place is that the facility has a place in his heart and for the party to leave it as they found it, though the only thing he considers 'unfinished business' is one of his experiments (not Vincent) serving as a boss fight for the party (which he set them up for).
-   Has displayed a pattern across both games of discarding subjects when they no longer interest him - he left behind Shinra manor and all his research notes once Sephiroth was born, leading to his experiment Vincent being abandoned in the basement and all the notes on the JENOVA Project sitting around in the basement for an older Sephiroth to stumble across. He also abandoned numerous other experiments which the party find and fight in *Rebirth*. *Remake* shows he presumably had a similar attitude to all the experiments abandoned in the facility under Midgar, and *Traces of Two Pasts* outright states he became brutal in his treatment of Ifalna - which led to her death - after he realized he had a 'spare' Cetra in Aerith, who had begun to hear the voices from the Planet. Had he followed through with his plan to crossbreed Aerith with other  SOLDIERs , she could have been subjected to the same fate as her mother.

Pretty much everything bad that happens, happened because he didn't understand what he was dabbling with.  (SPOILER) The worst of it was keeping Sephiroth's origins from him.

It's just that they're largely so blindly and fearfully loyal to Shinra that they usually shoot first and ask questions later, but on rare occasions one or two troopers *can* be reasoned with.

While no longer as physically abusive with her as he could be in OG VII (Where Tseng had no problems beating Aerith whatsoever despite his feelings), Remake Tsung is far more relaxed, but at the same time, far more subtly possessive of Aerith through his approach, mannerisms, and words, at one point smugly telling Cloud to ""Keep (her) safe for me"" in a way that you would refer to someone you were particularly close with. That said he's still fairly polite to Aerith despite her obvious displeasure at his actions and demeanor towards her, doesn't go out of his way to actively antagonize her outside the parameters of his job, and unlike Rude's case with Tifa, when he comes to direct confrontation he notably DOESN'T pull his punches against Aerith when it comes to throwing down against her, Yuffie, and Red XIII. It's notable that despite his actions throughout their history and who he's working for, Aerith genuinely doesn't hate him and is legitimately concerned when he's seemingly at death's door after encountering Sephiroth. Arguably his characterization in *Remake*/*Rebirth* compared to the original has him come off as more of a self aware [Hopeless Suitor](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor), (though considering this version of Tseng is 5 years older, making the 8-9 year age gap more considerable, it's likely just as much for implication concerns as it is for the players.)",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush

-   To Zack. His quest to become a hero contrasts with the same quest Genesis Rhapsodos undertakes, but whereas the latter's feelings of entitlement to the moniker of ""hero"" lead to obsession and downfall, Zack's quest to ""become a hero"" has less to do with personal glory and more with making the world a better place. Zack's will to become a hero motivated him to think for himself and to be guided by his moral compass and sense of justice, whereas Genesis's obsession with becoming a hero drove him to challenge those he saw as hindrances and a need to prove himself as superior to others. Both joined SOLDIER inspired by stories of the hero First Class Sephiroth, striving to emulate him, and both fall from Shinra's graces after learning of the company's corrupt ways. In an inversion of a typical hero-villain story dynamic, Zack dies whereas Genesis lives.
-   To Angeal as well. They are both  SOLDIERs  of Project G, both were inspired by Sephiroth to join SOLDIER and both can create copies of themselves. However Genesis and his copies are associated with black wings, whereas Angeal and his copies are associated with white wings, alluding to angel/fallen angel imagery. Both struggle with the man/monster dynamic, Genesis embracing it as it gives him special powers he can exploit to attain his goals, whereas Angeal begins to loath himself.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart

They're both famous First Class  SOLDIERs  that go rogue from Shinra and seek divine power. However, Sephiroth does so because he comes to think he's an Ancient and should rule the planet; Genesis is trying to save his own life and is resorting to desperate stretches of reason to find a way. Even their designs play into this; Genesis is short-haired, right-handed, has a wing on his left side, and wields a massive straight-bladed sword that he infuses with magic, while Sephiroth is long-haired, [left-handed](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHandedMirror), with a wing on the right side, and he wields a katana that he never empowers.

[He even tells them not to worry about his minor injury](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAFleshWound), which becomes bitterly ironic considering that it kickstarted both his physical, and eventual [mental degradation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage).
-   The second is when Zack defeats him during the [Final Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss) battle.

-   As a SOLDIER, he's a normal human that has been injected with Jenova's cells. However they manifest differently in him than in Sephiroth due to the different nature of how they received the cells, which is the major reason for his rebellion against Shinra; Genesis' genes are unstable and when he's injured in a sparring match, his body begins to undergo cellular degradation. This first shows itself when he manifests a black wing, but as the game goes on and his condition worsens, his hair lightens to white, and his skin begins to crack and scar.
-   The Genesis Copies created by grafting his cells onto humans take on his facial appearance and hair, but they also experience the same degradation he does at an accelerated rate. The result is that while a few of them look identical to Genesis, others look even more monstrous than he does to the point they're barely recognizable as human anymore, such as the [G-Warrior strains<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/File:G_Devastator_Artwork.jpg)<small>◊</small>.

-   More literally, while Genesis isn't the cause behind all of major problems in the world of *Final Fantasy VII* (that can be laid on Hojo's hands), he *did* instigate Sephiroth's loss of sanity in Nibelheim, and thus is partially to blame for Sephiroth becoming such a major threat to the planet in *VII* and later works. His name also implies that he was the first  SOLDIER  to be injected with Jenova cells, which would lead to Sephiroth being the perfection of it.

Like Zack, he too strives to be a hero more than anything, but unlike Zack, who admired and looked up to Sephiroth as his role model, Genesis *couldn't stand* living in his shadow, and took every opportunity he could at whatever pissing match could be mustered. Eventually, Sephiroth becomes completely exhausted with his competitive streak and couldn't care less if he was the hero of his twisted recreation of LOVELESS. Then there's the fact that, if he can't be cured of his condition, he will if nothing else attempt to take the entire world with him.

However, the way he appears in *Crisis Core* allows him to be there without actually retconning the event's other depictions — he appears when Zack and Sephiroth enter the reactor, and the only version of that specific scene that has been shown across the series is the one where Cloud is in Zack's place, so Genesis's absence could be given a [Hand Wave](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave) as one of many inconsistencies in Cloud's memories. These inconsistencies are in fact constantly brought up by Tifa in *Rebirth.*<ul>

Furthermore, in *Dirge of Cerberus*, Nero was able to work in team to revive his brother and simply let Azul die when the latter failed against Vincent. In Intermission, Nero kills his allies and admits that there is no team in Deepground.

He even takes it a step further and *recites her dying [Last Words](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords)* just to twist the knife more. In the original, she was another casualty of his burning of Nibelheim, and her death wasn't brought up again.

When he appears he tends to be focused on mocking and tormenting Cloud, which is accurate to his characterization in *Advent Children* (as well as spin-offs like *Kingdom Hearts* and *Dissidia*), but isn't much like his original *Final Fantasy VII* incarnation, where he was focused on other goals and didn't pay Cloud any notice unless he was in a position to be a complication in Sephiroth's plans. He still has shades of his original *VII* personality, but they're downplayed in favor of his rivalry with Cloud. Somewhat justified by the game being ambiguous on when Sephiroth is actually appearing to Cloud, and when Cloud's psychological problems are causing him to hallucinate Sephiroth; it could be that the times Sephiroth is more openly contemptuous of Cloud are when it's just in his head.

-   Cloud is tormented by flashbacks and visions of him throughout the game, but it's sometimes ambiguous when Sephiroth is actually appearing to him and when Cloud is just hallucinating. The game's *Ultimania* guide specifies that there are four forms of Sephiroth in the game; the one that appears to Cloud in visions, the one in Cloud's flashbacks, the one manifested through the black-cloaked men, and the one that  (SPOILER) is fought at the end of the game . The guide doesn't specify exactly what the nature of the fourth Sephiroth is and leaves his existence as a question mark.
-   In an instance only in the Japanese voice-over, when Sephiroth appears  (SPOILER) at the End of the World , he uses the personal pronoun of *ore* 俺 as heard in *[Crisis Core](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore)*, instead of the more formal *watashi* 私 he uses in all his other appearances after his turn to villainy. Given the past consistency in his pronouns this is certainly a deliberate creative choice and not just a writer's oversight, but it's unclear what it could mean.  (SPOILER) Cloud could possibly be talking to an entirely different Sephiroth, one from the *Crisis Core* era, or it could mean that Sephiroth in the present (or the future) has had a shift in his personality and motivations. 
-   During a protorelic sidequest, Sephiroth  (SPOILER) briefly meets Gilgamesh and is taken aback by seeing him and senses that he is a lost soul. It is unsaid if he actually recognizes him and if he does what that means for what Sephiroth actually is at the moment. </ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation

However, said subtext is play for horror, and he still makes derisive and cruel comments toward Cloud tormenting him for his failure to stop the Sector 7 plate from falling. He also vaguely alludes to his future goals in a sinister undertone, strongly hinting he is [hiding the true depth of his sadism](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftSpokenSadist) until it's time to reveal it.

Also, the fight against Cloud during the game's finale ends with Sephiroth easily defeating Cloud. This means Sephiroth walked away at the end of *Remake* with the win, having gotten everything he wanted and defeating the heroes. The only reason that *Remake* has a [Bittersweet Ending](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding) instead of a [Downer Ending](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding) is because the good guys still have a chance to stop Sephiroth from enacting the rest of his plan.

At the end of the game,  (SPOILER) when Cloud correctly points out that the Planet isn't rejoicing at having all of the timelines crammed together into one, it's *screaming in agony*, the mask fully comes off and Sephiroth spends the rest of the game engaging in cold-blooded torture out of anger at being told he's wrong, to such a degree that it alters his fighting style to be about inflicting as much pain as possible rather than actually winning the fight.

As the fight continues, he gets to show off spells unique to himself as well as an entirely different form of Elemental Infusion that no one else showed in the game with new elemental spells to pack it all up.

He has to put on a tough gambit against Rufus and pretend to be Glenn, who is anything *but* stoic in his attempts to ruthlessly guilt trip the new ruler for his manipulations, and he genuinely falters during cases like his accidental summoning of Gilgamesh, when Tseng kills a clone he was actively controlling after he expected the Turk to be down and out, or when Aerith manages to catch him off-guard in the final battle and support the party post-mortem.

-   In the finale, he reveals that while he still holds on to his dream of existing forever  (SPOILER) he doesn't actually want to destroy Cloud anymore either.

The fact he honestly asks Cloud to [join him](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether)  (SPOILER) despite burning down Cloud's hometown and killing Cloud's mother *and gloating about it*  speaks volumes to how little he understands or cares about others emotions. However, it is shown in *Rebirth* that he wasn't always so detached; he detested Hojo for his experiments on people, and tried searching for the Infantryman swept away by the river on Mt.

In the original game, they defeated him in his Safer-Sephiroth form but that form was simply throwing his raw power at the party.

The prime examples are him scaring the shit out of Palmer by just choosing to walk past him while ignoring him, scaring a bunch of kids with one of his creepy clones in Sector 5 before Cloud even showed up, or  (SPOILER)  playing a silent ""made you look"" before teleporting and casually floating off to get Cloud to climb a big ladder on the top of the Shinra building and halfassedly jumping off with a smile when Cloud almost gets to the top .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll

While Sephiroth is presented as even stronger overall than he was in *Remake*, his swordsmanship skills have begun to atrophy as he leans into his new powers instead, to his detriment. The final phase of his  (SPOILER) fight in *Rebirth* has very simple patterns to block or dodge, with reliance on excessively flashy skewering techniques and shows of force using Whispers as projectiles that leave him vulnerable, in contrast to the overwhelmingly fast and brutal assault he preferred in *Remake*.

Despite being isolated by his enhanced abilities, pre-breakdown he shows himself to be a good and heroic man with many redeeming qualities. Having no knowledge of the actual truth of his origins and parents due to being lied to his entire life (namely: his real parents, that he *is* human, and his abilities are a result of human experimentation in the womb to inject him with Mako and Jenova cells), he then stumbles across Shinra's research on Jenova with its incorrect conclusions and gets driven insane by the implications, with no one around who can correct him and assuage his worst fears about being inhuman.

Being the most powerful man alive aside, he pretty much proves to also have the legendary combat skills to be the greatest warrior on the planet when he single-handedly fights in his human form against the entire party by himself and shows off incredible swordsmanship and magical abilities to hold them off while clearly not displaying all the abilities he had due to needing them in the future.
