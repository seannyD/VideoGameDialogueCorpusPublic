He wanted to make Tidus a star blitzball player like him, but his attempts to do so involved berating his son and acting like he would never amount to anything. Part of Jecht's development in Spira is realizing he messed up, and owns up to his mistakes in the end, realizing his son has every reason to hate him.

Because of all of this, Jecht has absolutely no way to resonate or bond with a child who doesn't share in the machismo, and his attempts to make Tidus like him backfire since instead he just becomes a bully towards his son. While he does love Tidus, he has trouble talking to him without coming off as a condescending jerk, which made Tidus both hate and fear him. It takes him journeying through Spira, giving up drinking, and learning he never will be able to return home to fully admit his failures, and even then he cannot do anything to fix it until Tidus is almost an adult.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFX2/,Final Fantasy X-2,Jecht,Jecht,Puzzle Boss,0," [Puzzle Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss): In the fight with Braska's Final Aeon, he has two pillars behind him that will each heal him for 1500 health every turn, for a total of 3000 health if both are active. If you are underleveled, they can easily undo the damage dealt to him. AND their healing ability also increases Jecht's overdrive gauge. Fortunately the two pillars can be attacked, and if they lose all their health, they are knocked out for a few turns, allowing for uninterrupted damage on Jecht. The rub is that all extra damage they take when being knocked out gets permanently added to their total health when they revive. So if they have 5000 health total, and you were to knock one out with an attack that does 5500 damage, when they get back up, they'll have 500 extra health (and if you were to knock them out with 15000 damage, they'd revive with 15000 health). This means that you have to be careful with how much you damage them (and be careful with Aeon overdrives), because if they gain too much health, knocking them out becomes less and less feasible, turning the fight into a long battle of attrition.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss

-   However, had his goals not involved dragging Yuna and her guardians so close to him, it's very arguable they would never be in a position to learn about Yevon's corruption from Mika in the first place, and thus could possibly be more accepting of Yunalesca's own [Awful Truth](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth), likely making it harder for Auron to convince them to reject Yunalesca and the Final Aeon.

-   Also, in the original Japanese, the homonyms detailed above are *not* a coincidence; in particular, the ""deity"" meaning is descriptive, as a malevolent deity that goes around punishing people for their transgressions (and killing them - ""shin"" again) is what the creature is meant to come across as.

Dream Zanarkand is a mirror of the city during the height of its power. It has all elements of conflict and war removed from it, basically a utopia.

-   The Leg has an attack named Vita Brevis, meaning ""life is short,"" which is taken from a quote by Hippocrates (of Hippocratic Oath fame). It also fires magic bullets, the most impressive of which is an eight-shot volley called Dies Irae, or ""day of wrath,"" named after a hymn describing the day of judgment.

By the end, he views them as ""nothing but low-life tricksters"" who are just getting in the way.
-   This is the crux of his rocky ""relationship"" with Beclem in *X-2*.

Rikku herself seems to fantasize about one day possessing Lulu's, ahem, [talent](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism). She also develops this relationship with Tidus over time, offering him pieces of advice regarding the world in a firm but caring way.

Late-game however, the tides start to turn, especially if/when the player completes Yuna's Sphere grid and moves her on to start learning Lulu's magic. Towards the endgame, the only way for Lulu to break the 9999 damage limit is by dodging two hundred *consecutive* lightning bolts in the painfully difficult and tedious Lightning Dodge game. Many players skip it entirely and relegate Lulu to a supporting role in favor of characters like Yuna who can break the damage limit with little difficulty.

She also goes from telling Tidus not to romantically pursue Yuna to personally requesting that he stay with her after Sin has been defeated.

There's also the bit on the *S.S. Liki* where the camera looks through Tidus' binoculars and he's staring straight at her chest. Her victory pose is also another very unsubtle chest focus.

-   The reason he tends to be seen as the worst playable character. His Sphere Grid is small, with the intent being that the player moves him into the other characters Sphere Grids and shape him to be more to their liking. However, while dipping into the other characters Sphere Grids is recommended in general, Kimahri takes more work do this since the resources to move into other characters make it hard to justify doing so, meaning that when the player finally does have the ability to invest heavily in him, the other characters have outpaced him so much that he simply is not worth investing into.
-   Thankfully, all of the above gets averted by the Expert Sphere Grid in the International and HD versions of the game, which has many more intersecting paths - this allows Kimahri to flawlessly become a [Red Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage) that's an effective attacker, a competent spellcaster, and a utilitarian for any other skills in between.

This makes him very versatile and able to be molded to whatever role you need easily. The trade-off is that he's also a [Master of None](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone), since he will inevitably trail behind anyone whose grid he enters, while Rikku joins at such a low sphere level that she'll pass him even if Kimahri is ahead of her at first.

However, if you can get your [Relationship Values](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues) with her high enough, she reveals the reasons she acts this way and also shows she can be rather insightful.
-   The death of her mother taught her that you can't waste your life being sad, and that you need to live it up while you can, especially in a [Crapsack World](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) like Spira.
-   In Guadosalam, she reflects she's already looking to get married once she meets the right guy. Tidus lampshades she's a bit young to be thinking that way, but Rikku explains in a world where fiends or Sin could kill you at any moment, why wait until she's ""older"" to think about it? She also wants to have a lot of kids so they'll have a big family to take care of each other if anything happens to her or the father.
-   In *Last Mission* (which takes place 3 months after *X-2*) where Rikku keeps herself busy and helps everyone out all the time because she feels like life is meant be something you make of yourself and it frustrates her that Yuna just wants to live a quiet life in Besaid.

All Al Bhed believe in the power of science over Yevon, but Rikku offers some perfectly reasonable justifications for her lack of belief in spiritual matters. There's also the fact that she believes in an afterlife of sorts, as shown from when she tells Yuna and Tidus that she'll ""see them again"". It's really more like she's an [Agent Scully](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully), who has *a* spiritual belief; just not the ""main"" one, as it were.

-   *X-2* includes an optional hotsprings scene where she blatantly checks out Yuna's body and remarks: ""I know who's got it goin' on."" A later scene has Rikku compare herself and Yuna to Lenne and her dead lover, Shuyin, respectively, because both she and Shuyin tried to save the ones they loved.

She isn't a great fighter and it'll be a while before she can learn any good magic, so her main contribution will probably be in using items.

-   The prayer pose was originally a blitzball ritual used in Zanarkand.
-   the Hymn of the Fayth was used as a protest song by people against Bevelle, before the religion turned it into a prayer.

Even still, outside of those two individuals, Seymour (half-human half-Guado), Yuna (half-human half-Al Bhed), and Yuna's guardians Rikku (Al Bhed) and Kimahri (Ronso), no maester, summoner, guardian, or anyone else of any rank is shown. Despite being a maester, Kelk Ronso is still [Locked Out of the Loop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop) regarding the depths of corruption at the top of the church.
-   The Al Bhed in particular faced even worse racism, dating back to before their founding. The race was previously known as the Bedohls, who supplied Bevelle with machina, and were used as slaves. After the Machina War, Bevelle founded the Yevon faith, blamed the Bedohls for the war Bevelle started and the presence of Sin, and began a campaign of genocide.

-   Mindy is the Mage. She's a [Glass Cannon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon) with the lowest HP and weakest defenses of the trio, but has the highest magic stats. She uses magic the most frequently and tends to favor nuking the enemy with high-powered offensive spells.
-   Sandy is the Thief. Her HP and defenses are better than Mindy's, but not as high as Cindy's, though she is the fastest of the trio and has the best physical attacking stats.

-   To reflect on the above paragraph, his voice is deeper in the opening montage than in his earliest canonical appearances. James Arnold Taylor did this intentionally to indicate the character's newfound maturity. However, it's also a result of his voice actor being given poor direction: James Arnold Taylor believed Tidus was narrating events from well into the future, and gave him an older voice for those parts. It doesn't match up with the the youthful voice Tidus uses even after the game catches up with his narration.
-   At the start of the game.

Ironically, [he has issues with telling Garnet his true feelings towards her despite his many flirtatious comments.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut) Meanwhile, Tidus doesn't seem all too interested in flirting with other girls.

However, he is very aware about his feelings towards Yuna and [he makes it very clear to her how he much he loves her.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss)
-   Both eventually learn the truths about who they are late in the story, but their purposes couldn't be any more different. Zidane learns the [Awful Truth](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth) that [he's a Genome created for the sole purpose of destroying all life on Gaia,](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon) the world he's grown to love.

Other than that, [Tidus has no real importance in the grand scheme of things other than being a Blitzball star from Zanarkand.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne) This is important, as Tidus doesn't seem to care all too much about it and this lack of importance is what allows him to speak his mind on the state of the [Crapsack World](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) that is Spira and influence his companions, most importantly of all, Yuna, into striving to make their world a better place rather than dying to false hope.
-   Gameplay-wise, while both are very agile and evasive in combat, their roles are quite different. Zidane is a classic thief who's all about stealing, [dual wields](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding) daggers, and uses his non-traditional ""thief-swords"" in combat.

However, he's somewhat lacking in the health and defense departments, meaning that, when fighting most major bosses (who are often just as fast as Tidus and immune to his slowing attacks), you're better off using someone hardier, as Tidus will just end up dying a lot. That being said, if the player dips into Auron's side of the Sphere Grid a little, Tidus will quickly become a [Lightning Bruiser](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser) who hits as hard as Auron, but is faster, and much more durable as a result.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster

-   As noted above, Tidus can be something of a [Fragile Speedster](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster). In game, Jecht talks about how Tidus needs to put on some muscle and is still only skin and bones when he's grown up.
-   Tidus brags about being the superstar player of the Zanarkand Abes. He can more than live up to it if you play blitzball, particularly if you exploit the Jecht Shot. Tidus can go on a tear and score far more goals than anyone else, winning you special prizes.

He's a fast swimmer and an excellent shooter. Many of his techniques are also special types of shots that give him a better chance of scoring.

It also caused some interesting problems during the dub for *X-2*, which led to Tidus being the last character in a voice-acted *Final Fantasy* whose name is chosen by the player.

Tidus is also the only party member to notice that Auron is an unsent, long before Auron reveals this secret to him.

-   He's noted to look much like Wakka's younger brother Chappu. When Chappu shows up, there are some notable facial similarities.
-   The ""Tidus"" recording turns out to be Shuyin, the main antagonist of *X-2*. It's a little unclear whether Tidus was based on Shuyin or not, but they share the same backstory and voice actors. The difference is that Shuyin fought and died in the Machina War, never got sent, became unstable, and turned evil (it's also implied that Shuyin is older, which gives a possibility that Tidus may become like Shuyin. *X-2.5* lightly shows how Tidus becomes a bit unstable after his lovers' quarrel with Yuna).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger

(The way he spikes the ball during his Jecht Shot somewhat resembles how he swings his sword in battle.) Wakka later notes that, for a ""Newbie"", he can handle himself pretty well in a fight.

When Auron first hands him a sword, he doesn't seem to know what to do with it and falls on his rear end trying to swing it around.

-   Either because she's reunited with Tidus in the [Golden Ending](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding). Or, if you fail to unlock the reunion scene, she finally accepts that she and Tidus will never meet again and makes peace with it.
-   Regardless of which of the aforementioned endings you earn, the Audio Drama CD [deep-sixes their relationship](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking) anyway by having Yuna angrily confront Tidus on suspicions of cheating on her.

However, after learning about the full details of Sin's origins and nature from Yunalesca, Yuna and her friends actively [defy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope) this approach, seeking to instead find a way to *permanently* end Sin.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice

-   In the first game, of her father's reputation as the most recent High Summoner (the one who defeated Sin), Yuna is seen as the person with an equal or even greater chance of repeating his feat. She herself exemplifies this attitude by trying to make everyone's lives a little happier, no matter the cost, as she explains to Tidus.
-   In the second game, she's not only lived up to the expectations set for her in the first game, but has created the Eternal Calm (effectively making her the greatest High Summoner ever), and she is possibly the most respected figure in the world.

Already embarrassed by her celebrity in the prequel, she spent at least a year in seclusion on Besaid after defeating Sin, and since then she's stayed out of the public eye.

However, one visible example of this trope comes when she views the sphere where ""Tidus"" says he needs to save some girl named Lenne. At that point, she *can't* hold it in any longer and even asks herself ""Why am I so mad?!""

However, her Sphere Grid also does a good job of buffing her magical stats as well, meaning that by dipping into Lulu's Sphere Grid to learn offensive magical spells, Yuna becomes a more potent offensive spellcaster then even Lulu can, and this also greatly benefits the Aeons as well thanks to deriving their stats from Yuna.
