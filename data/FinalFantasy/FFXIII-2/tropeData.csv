Even a vision of Serah didn't get emotion out of her, she noted, and is justifiably worried. The truth zigzags this trope — she's become powerful enough to be considered a goddess in her own right, but the real reason her emotions are dampened is because Bhunivelze extracted part of her soul when he made her the Savior.

The *X-2* Yuna cosplay garb and the Miqo'te cosplay garb are also notable in this regard, but there's plenty more as well, some even being bikini styled. It's also worth noting that most of her sexier outfits (such as Electronia, Witching Hour, Amazon Warrior, Rhapsody in Rose, etc.) have better stats than the other ones, further encouraging players to wear them.
