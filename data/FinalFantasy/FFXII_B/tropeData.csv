In the former, it's not readily apparent since he's only of nominal importance to the plot, but side quests and NPC conversations paint him as nothing if not hypercompetent, and he has [the stats](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking) of a god. You could call him an ""Ace in training""; he's got the potential, but he's still young and inexperienced.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce

While Tidus is relegated to the back when meeting the locals, Vaan is [The Face](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace) because the rest of the party are wanted men. Tidus ultimately is in his own story and Vaan is the viewpoint of several.

Likewise in *XII*, too, when he get's particularly annoyed or peeved at someone or something. Although in *XII*, this is more noticeable prior to Ashe joining the party permanently. And the player is just as likely to see Vaan on the end of another Deadpan Snarker, particularly during his more naive moments.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Decoy Protagonist,0," [Decoy Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist): He's the initial viewpoint character, but once Ashe joins the party the story begins focusing on her development a lot more than his. He remains important to the plot throughout the entire game simply by virtue of being a [Foil](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil) to Ashe and a valuable party member.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist

-   Similarly, just how athletic and hunky Vaan is depends on the artsyle, and even the very game or piece of media itself. In *XII*, FMV sequences portray Vaan at his most buff. *Revenant Wings* revamps him to appear more sterotypically ""youthful kid"", downplaying his physique tremendously most of the time. *Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy*, conversely, plays up his buff-ness, showing Vaan at his most cut. *Tactics A2* downplays only insofar as his loose-fitting shirt doesn't flatter his muscle tone as clearly as his vest does, but he generally back to be more atheletic in appearance than *Revenant Wings*.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,False Flag Operation,0," [False Flag Operation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation): He pulls this off near the end of *XII*. He  (SPOILER) uses [Balthier's](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkyPirate) [vocal modulator](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun) to pose as <img class=""ymmv1 rounded"" src=""/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png"" title=""This example contains a YMMV entry.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Flanderization,0," [Flanderization](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization): In the game proper and *Revenant Wings*, Vaan is portrayed as an [Idiot Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero) street urchin, having his moments of being gullible and cocky, as well as being [Hot-Blooded](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded) and easily angered, but never is this shown as his one defining trait, instead just a part of his character that also makes room for him to be insightful, able to reflect on his own life decisions and learn from them, as well as providing his own form of wisdom to Ashe later in the game. He does have a few occasional jokes and scenes where the party doesn't take him seriously or scoff at his naivety, but they still regard both him and Penelo as valuable allies. The manga and *Dissidia 012*, however, crank up his idiocy and naivety to the point of stereotyping, as he becomes exceedingly immature and comedic to the point where he forgets people's names often, and has *three* pre-battle dialogues in the latter game where he asks for the opponent's age, and reacts to  (SPOILER) Feral Chaos  like a child getting to a new boss in a video game.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Foil,0," [Foil](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil): To Ashe, paralleling her in backstory and [Character Development](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment) as a citizen of Rabanastre who lost a loved one to the Empire and desires vengeance. However, while Vaan eventually realizes how pointless revenge is and lets go of Reks' death, Ashe takes longer to get over Rasler. Atop the Pharos when he tells this lesson to Gabranth, Vaan's example inspires her to follow his lead and not use the Sun-Cryst's power.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,He Cleans Up Nicely,0," [He Cleans Up Nicely](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeCleansUpNicely): In *Tactics A2*, the addition of a fine white shirt to his wardrobe takes him from scruffy street thief to dashing Sky Pirate.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeCleansUpNicely
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Heroes Prefer Swords,0, [Heroes Prefer Swords](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords): Swords are his starting weapon and preferred weapons in sequels and in the artwork. They ([along with sabers and blades anyway](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllSwordsAreTheSame)) are the only weapons available to the Sky Pirate class in *Tactics A2*. The [Updated Re-release](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease) instead gives him a dagger to start with.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Heroic Build,0," [Heroic Build](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild): Outside of *Revenant Wings* where the artstyle portrays Vaan to look more like the stereotypical idea of a young teenager, Vaan is a very athletically toned guy. His explicit training against the rats in the Garamsythe Waterway and other like things proves to be quite the exercise regiment, which his desert-dweller's atire shows off well. This is even remarked in-universe: a Jaharan Garif notes that Vaan is surprsingly well-built for someone his young age (17, so not an unrealistic thing at that point).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Idiot Hero,1," [Idiot Hero](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero): Subverted in the original game; though he's impulsive and a bit naive, Vaan is clever, resourceful, and has a fair amount of scenes where he shows a more inquisitive and insightful side. The manga, however, [makes this his defining trait](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization), cranking up his [Hot Bloodedness](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded) and making him rather arrogant and cocky, but lacking the skill and intelligence to back them up. *Dissidia 012* likewise dials up the idiocy to the point he has trouble remembering simple names.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Infinity +1 Sword,0," [Infinity +1 Sword](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword): In *Revenant Wings*, he gains the exclusive weapon Anastasia, the best weapon in the game once a bonus dungeon is completed to power it up.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,"I See Them, Too",0," [I See Them, Too](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeThemToo): For reasons that go largely unremarked upon in-game, he can see the same spectral vision of  (SPOILER) Gerun posing as  Rasler that Ashe can throughout the game, though to him the specter takes the form of his dead brother Reks. The main point of the revelation is to reassure Ashe that she's not crazy and to hint that  (SPOILER) she might be being manipulated by it , while the deeper meaning appears to be that  (SPOILER) Gerun and the Occuria are dry-running him to be Take Two at this whole ""Modern Dynast-King"" bit should Ashe fail .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeThemToo
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Jumped at the Call,0," [Jumped at the Call](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall): In *Revenant Wings*, he jumps on the first opportunity he saw to go on another adventure.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,The Lancer,0," [The Lancer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer): Vaan plays this role to Ashe, by being her [foil](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil) given that he is a street urchin in contrast to the refugee princess when both have lost family to the Arcadian empire  (SPOILER)  and both are groomed to replaced the Dynast King.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Legendary in the Sequel,0, [Legendary in the Sequel](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryInTheSequel): Already a world-famous sky pirate in *[Final Fantasy Tactics A2](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2)*,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryInTheSequel
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Leitmotif,0," [Leitmotif](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif): Associated with the cutscene-specific song ""The Dream to be a Sky Pirate"", which plays as he affirms said dream to Penelo at the start of the game, with an air of inspiration and freedom. The main notes come from the song later used as the theme for the Salikawood.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Limit Break,0," [Limit Break](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak): His Quickenings are [Red Spiral](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight), [White Whorl](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe), and [Pyroclasm](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire), but they consume a substantial amount of MP to use and need skill and luck to chain together.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Lovable Rogue,0, [Lovable Rogue](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue): Vaan is a skilled thief and pickpocket but one with a strong heart and drive to do what's right.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Magikarp Power,0," [Magikarp Power](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower): Begins at Level 1 with no LP, no magic, and barely anything else to his name. By Level 99, he's your party's MVP *bar none*.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Master of All,0," [Master of All](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll): In the original release, he's got all around amazing stats, having emphasis on strength (best score along with Basch), magick (second best score), vitality (best score), and speed (second best). Stats-wise, he's easily the best character of your party. The cherry on top of the cake is that *even his attack animations* are faster — Vaan can deliver combos in under half the time than the rest of the party (save Basch and Balthier) needs to execute the same amount of blows. In the *International Zodiac Job System* release, his strength is slightly nerfed, but overall he remains a powerhouse allowing him to be flexibly placed in any job.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Morality Pet,0," [Morality Pet](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet): Serves a variation of this trope for Ashe. Because Vaan is a citizen of Dalmasca who's lost loved ones to the war, he's essentially going through the same beats as her, but catching on quicker: at first he lets his hatred for the Empire dominate his judgement and acts recklessly because of it, until he grows out of this mindset in favor of simply protecting his homeland.  (SPOILER) The Occuria even try to use him as they're doing to Ashe, but unlike her, his doubts vanish way faster and he refuses to take revenge for Reks' death, knowing full well it won't do him any good. Ashe follows Vaan's example and rebels against the Occuria in the process. ",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Only One Name,0," [Only One Name](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName): In a game where most characters either have a last name or have taken an alias, Vaan never has his full name reveled. Courtesy of Old Dalan it's sometimes thought to be ""Ratsbane"", but it's a joke on how much time he spends fighting rats in the sewers and not actually his name.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Overshadowed by Awesome,0," [Overshadowed by Awesome](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome): Vaan isn't really a *bad* character, he just happens to be in a game where, as far as Western audiences are concerned, he and Penelo are not as interesting or developed as the other cast members.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome

It's also implied that he was going to be Occuria's plan B since he saw Reks at first where Ashe saw Rasler. He's letting go of his hatred for the Empire foiled that and led him to spare Gabranth.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Supporting Protagonist,0," [Supporting Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist): He serves as a [Foil](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil) to Ashe, both of them wanting to see Dalmasca restored and to claim vengeance for the death of their loved ones. However, Vaan's actions only drive the story up to when Ashe joins the party; after that the game follows her entirely, and Vaan just advises her like the other characters and acts as party leader in non-combat areas. He gets over this role in *Revenant Wings*, though, whereas Ashe's is somewhat downplayed.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist
../data/FinalFantasy/FFXII_B/,Final Fantasy XII,Vaan,Vaan,Tagalong Kid,0," [Tagalong Kid](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid): He is only two years younger than Ashe and is more of [The Lancer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer) towards her, but does not have a true connection to the main plot.

His betrayal is also a prime example of someone who fights for Dalmasca proving themselves untrustworthy to the main party in favor of siding with the Empire for a bloodless conflict, even if does end with Ashe as another puppet for Vayne, showcasing more of the game's approach to [Gray-and-Gray Morality](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGrayMorality) and how neither side of the war is truly good or evil.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss

Basch, the traitor even the Resistance is having a hard time believing in, welcomes Vaan politely and treats him like an equal. Vossler, the ""true"" son of Dalmasca, wrestles his sword out of Vaan's grip rudely and treats him, a citizen of the kingdom he's sworn to protect, with cold dismissal. While the interaction is small, Vaan later forgives and accepts Basch as being framed by the Archadian Empire, while Vossler betrays his charge's trust and sides with the Empire.<ul>
-   There are two lines from him that hint at his eventual betrayal; at the Dreadnought Leviathan, he'll mention to Basch that in order to get Ashe to cooperate, they need to have her ""meet the reality of the situation"", a perfect summation of his real perception of Dalmasca's current state. Once they escape to Bhujerba and he takes his leave, he tells Ashe to trust Basch, as his loyalty to Dalmasca is no less than his own. [Exact Words](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords) are at play here: their loyalty to Dalmasca really is unshaken, in Vossler's case maybe too much so, and bear in mind that Ashe is still coming down from thinking of Basch as a ""traitor"".</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing

Vossler's priority is and always has been the welfare of Dalmasca and its freedom, but the conflict has essentially diminished his hopes for the latter, resulting in his brusque, abrasive behavior by the time Basch returns. He's *so* beaten down by the war against Archades, in fact, he strikes a deal with Judge Ghis to restore Ashe to power and leave the kingdom unharmed, yet still under Imperial law, in exchange for the Dawn Shard.

Vossler has his mind set on the restoration of Dalmasca first and foremost. When Ashe reveals her intentions as revenge first, Dalmasca second, Vossler ends up siding with the Archadians. There's also a second factor in his betrayal in that the resistance's war from his perspective seems to be growing more futile as the days pass; and by allying with the Archadians, Vayne will actually restore Dalmasca's independence. In his favor, there's a fair chance Vayne may have lived up to his word, and politically it wouldn't have been a dreadful move for Vayne to restore the hearts and minds of the people, even if Ashe is a glorified [Puppet King](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing) to his own ends and means.

Most of the time, players summon them to unleash their [Limit Break](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak), but because their gambits are unknown [outside of consulting a guide](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt), you will not know how to do it.
