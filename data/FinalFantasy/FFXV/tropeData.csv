(SPOILER)  The player character does survive the ten years of waiting for Noctis, and helps supply him with a boat he uses to get to the mainland. What happens to them afterward, however, goes unanswered, and they obviously don't appear in the main game at all, leaving their ultimate fate up in the air. That is, until the the main game's *Royal Edition* was released. In one of the new side-missions in Insomnia, Noct and the gang are send to aid one of the Glaives on a mission who turns out to be the player character from *Comrades*. The group remembers them vaguely from their previous interactions in *Comrades* and make note about how their new companion [isn't very talkative](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicMime). After finishing the mission however, the Glaive simply disappears. While they're not present in the Glaives' hideout upon Noctis's return, he's told by another Glaive that the player character had said to have been honored to fight alongside him, to which Noct responds that he likewise was honored to fight alongside one of his father's Glaives.

The Royal Arms it mimics are the Blade of The Mystic, Sword of the Wise, Trident of The Oracle, Axe of The Conquerer and Sword of The Tall. Interestingly, the mimicked form of the Blade of the Mystic is used for the mimicked form of the Sword of The Wise. However, what sets it apart from those Royal Arms is that it draws on Noctis’ magic stat while all of the mimicked Royal Arms draw on Noctis’ attack stat, which makes sense, because while the Royal Arm makes a blade, it is still a blade of magic, and what sets it apart is that it’s mimicked weapons lack certain qualities of the originals. Particularly, it lacks the Sword of The Wise’s Warp Strike combo starter, the Blade of the Mystic’s long combo and stat buff, the Sword of The Fall’s body part dismemberment by getting a shorter combo, the Trident of The Oracle’s combo finisher and the Axe of The Conquerer’s stagger potential by virtue of only being regulated to air attacks, dodge attacks and combo finishers. This potentially makes this weapon a [Jack of All Trades](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades) and a [Master of None](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone) and [Magikarp Power](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower) if the player doesn’t prioritize the magic stat or figure out which of the mimicked weapons is the best to use because the player could potentially do little damage with the weapon by not prioritizing the magic stat and or using the less good mimicked weapons.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined

It especially stands out when compared to his teammates and even his own father looking completely European. Ironically, while there was a point in time when the setting and characters were supposed to be Japanese-inspired ([Yakuza](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza) specifically), Noctis's original design looked a lot more European. Interestingly he still averts this trope as an older man, despite looking a lot more like his (clearly white) father; he still retains a lot his East Asian features, with the overall result being that he looks more like a fairly realistic depiction of a mixed ancestry Eurasian man than the ""stateless"" ambiguity the trope implies.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki

While he is a very kind, sweet, generous, and gentle guy, he has his grumpy moments and is prone to mood swings, responding in a snappish tone when more polite responses could be used. This can be seen towards his father during their final farewell scene the moment Drautos calls out to Noctis at the stairs. Noctis is also snappy to Prompto when his friend inquires of Noctis’s messages to Luna, and towards Ignis in the *Brotherhood* Ignis episode when the young advisor was giving Noctis a report on the Kingdom and his weakening father, as well as many other moments.
-   Seems to be a bit of the Type 1 kind towards Luna.

This is likely to be an allusion to Ardyn in the game, pretending to be a benevolent and helpful man, offering advice and guiding the group on their journey, while manipulating them for his own machinations, even confessing to Noctis that he has no intention of killing him as a mortal... because he wants him to rise as the True King.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSamaritan

With each absorption, his mind and personality becomes more twisted - when Verstael first found him, he was deeply depressed and broken, but by experimenting with his powers, he became certifiably giddy and completely insane.

-   In keeping with Niflheim's similarities to the Gestahlian Empire of *[Final Fantasy VI](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI)*, Ardyn acts as a parallel to Kefka; [The Dragon](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon) to [The Emperor](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor) who is much more eccentric and silly than him, is clearly up to his own agenda, and acts as the primary representative of the Empire that the party interacts with. Much as Kefka kills General Leo and Emperor Gestahl, Ardyn kills Ravus and mutates Aldercapt. Further, they both cause [The End of the World as We Know It](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt), and the game picks up in a [Time Skip](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip) [After the End](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) where the heroes must kill him to set things right in the world. *XV* even reuses the ""World of Ruin"" title in its final chapter to cement the similarities. The key difference is that Kefka was an insane and cackling harlequin whose maniacal villainy was a symptom of his deep-seated nihilism, while Ardyn is a composed and calculating schemer who hides the smoldering rage that really drives him. As further parallels, Kefka was a [Monster Clown](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown), while Ardyn is a [Sharp-Dressed Man](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan), and they're both humorous and mocking [Trolls](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll), but Kefka is loud and obnoxious with his humor while Ardyn is more quiet and deadpan.
-   Like [Caius Ballad](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2) before him, Ardyn is a chosen one with a grudge against the gods. Caius sought to destroy the Heart of Etro inside him after witnessing Yeul's endless cycle of death and rebirth, while Ardyn was only pushed over the edge after Aera's death and being told of his true calling as the Starscourge's vessel. Caius's immortality was bestowed by Etro, while Ardyn's was inadvertently obtained by his soul being trapped in the Crystal. Both succeed in their goal (Etro's death for Caius, the extinction of the Caelum dynasty for Ardyn), though Caius eventually redeems himself by becoming the guardian of the Unseen Realm, while Ardyn is completely wiped out by the Lucii.
-   He's also one for [Garland from the original Final Fantasy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI). Both of them are traitors to their kingdom, have demonic powers, are far more important to their game’s plot than they initially let on and are both [final bosses](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss) fought at a time period significantly removed from the rest of the game. The main difference is that while Garland was a brute who wanted power for powers sake and is totally defeated, Ardyn is [The Chessmaster](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) who was corrupted by forces beyond his control and either wins via [Xanatos Gambit](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit) (in base *XV*) or gets exactly what he wants (in *Dawn of the Future*).

-   Despite literally being a man out of time, Ardyn seems to have developed quite a fondness for automobiles. He adores his red muscle car, and at multiple points in the story expresses admiration for the Regalia. When he rests at a bench in *Episode Ardyn*, his choice of reading material is a car magazine, which apparently features the same muscle car he'll later own on the cover!
-   While he absolutely abhores the Lucian Caelum bloodline, surprisingly it doesn't seem to extend to hating the kingdom of Lucis itself. In fact, it seems that he actually still has some fondness towards his home, and sincerely wants to at least sit on the throne of Lucis and finally become King, regardless of how twisted the sentiment is. He seems to sincerely lament that Insomnia would fall to ruins as Niflheim attacks it, and smiles as he sits on the throne of Insomnia. During the time he is in, the worst that he did was just having the entire city infested by Daemons and Magitek. He could have easily just obliterated all the remnants of Insomnia just to spite Noctis, leaving only the Citadel, but instead he straight up proudly calls Insomnia as the crown city of *his* kingdom and he rains down meteors in hardly any significant places. He even goes as far as to immediately stomp on the throne of Lucis when Noctis calls him a ""jester"" and stops speaking for a moment, almost sounding as if he was holding back tons of rage when he does speak again, clearly infuriated at not being acknowledged as a legitimate king of Lucis.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths

The *Episode Prompto* DLC includes a violin and piano version, and *Episode Ignis* has a version that's much heavier on the organ and adds an ominous background chorus of male vocals. *Royal Edition* adds a third version to the base game, used when he raises the Wall around Insomnia during the trek to the Citadel in the end-game, which is much more frantic and fast-paced to fit with Ardyn razing the city around Noctis as it plays.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif

-   Ardyn is derived from the Latin *ardēns* (""ardent/passionate""), which perfectly describes his personality—both in his desire to save people as a healer 2000 years ago, and his subsequent hatred towards his treacherous brother's bloodline; it can also mean ""burning/fiery"", which is appropriate given his partnership with Ifrit.
-   Izunia is derived from *iizuna*, the Japanese name for [the species of weasel<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_weasel), which befits his deceptive nature post-betrayal.
-   His true name, Ardyn *Lucis Caelum*, becomes quite fitting when you consider his status as a [Satanic Archetype](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype).
-   His sword is named the ""Rakshasa Blade""; in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, rakshasa were evil, man-eating demons who were powerful warriors and sorcerers, and were also masters of illusion capable of assuming different forms.

It has even been revealed that Ardyn was 33 years old at the time of his imprisonment, the same age Jesus was crucified. In even more blatant imagery, one of the endings to *Episode Ardyn* has Bahamut chain Ardyn up in a [Crucified Hero Shot](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrucifiedHeroShot), while an image of Aera (implied to be created by Bahamut) uses the Trident of the Oracle to stab him.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype

-   Aside from causing [the Long Night and ending the line of Lucian kings](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds), Ardyn's main goal in the game is making Noctis suffer, through mind games, hurting the people he loves, or just acting extremely annoying and creepy. He even occasionally helps out Noctis and the group, just to mess with their heads some more and make them wonder what he's up to.
-   In *Kingsglaive*, he is very mocking and condescending towards Regis in every line of dialogue he has, and refers to Noctis getting married as ""one more small, trivial thing [he] forgot to mention.""
-   Chapter 13 is infamous in the fanbase for being a long, difficult, frustrating dungeon. And it is full of Ardyn constantly mocking Noctis over the intercom.
-   As Noctis is being dragged into the Crystal for his empowerment, Ardyn tells him that he'll ""keep his friends company"" while he's gone. When the group shows up immediately after, Ardyn just walks away, smirking; his comment was just one more dig at getting under Noctis' skin.
-   On the train he uses his powers to make Prompto take on his appearance, tricking Noctis into attacking him. He then takes it a step further by impersonating Prompto and manipulating Noctis further, while copying Prompto's speech patterns and helping him fight Imperials. When Noctis sees him afterward, Ardyn quips ""I think I've earned the right to call you 'Noct' now"", and he will do so repeatedly through the rest of the game.
-   In *Episode Ignis*, he briefly disguises himself as Gladiolus when approaching Ignis and Ravus. The two are in no state to fight and Ardyn has several troops that capture them outright a moment later; he was just trying to have fun, and is disappointed when Ravus immediately sees through the deception and calls him out on it. And then once the two are subdued, Ardyn makes them watch as he kneels over an unconscious Noctis and casually brandishes a dagger over him, thinking aloud if he should just kill him now.<ul>
-   In the same scene, Ardyn even trolls a Magitek Trooper, putting his hat on it and patting it into place as he walks past.</ul>
-   In *Episode Ardyn*, one of his gameplay mechanics involves...destroying town decorations celebrating Founder's Day. Balloons, banners, signs - [and he does it all with a glee and campy one-liner](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll

A few of them are explicitly said to be dead, but they're still available for Noct to summon after these ""deaths"" and still appear in the story. The lore implies that their true forms are perhaps on another plane of existence, and what you see in-game are merely physical forms they've taken on this plane because they felt like it; killing those forms means nothing to them but maybe a brief power loss. Further complicating things is that they were said to be sleeping before Lunafreya began her journey to awaken them and form covenants with them, but what that ""sleep"" means for them is unclear.  (SPOILER) *The Dawn of the Future* confirms that they exist both on the physical plane and ""The Beyond"", and cannot truly be killed unless slain in both.

They also do *not* come to help you on command whenever you want like they're your pets, they will come when they feel like it and when the environment is hospitable towards them. Finally, the only reason they even give Noctis and Lunafreya the time of day is because they themselves are somewhat divine themselves, as the bloodline of the Oracle and the King of Lucis, and most of the time they keep to themselves away from human civilization and prefer not to be disturbed.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction
