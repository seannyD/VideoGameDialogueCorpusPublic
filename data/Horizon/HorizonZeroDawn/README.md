Some sidequest and choice dialogue missing.

## Gender coding

Contestant dialogue recoded using voice from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrkeD_ZGEVI

"Attacker" is coded by voice and clothes:

-----
Carja Artisan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kQeOSy1Q60 41:57. There are lots of Carja artisans but this one is male. (Later we hear two females discussing Aloy as she moves through the city with Erend, for example, but they're not in the script)

Eclipse Officer - (rotate turret line) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO19G3wZn2Q 19:14
"Nora Gate Guard" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPWl8O53E78 0:33
"Oseram Outlander" - checked both lines against gameplay footage, voice is male. 

Synthetic Voice is sometimes male and sometimes female. Have checked lines, and marked male as "Synthetic Voice (Zero Dawn)". 

There are several different "Nora Brave" characters, but they all appear to be male (verified with "Yeah! Faceless wretch!"; "Victory for the All Mother" and "For the Nora!", among others.). 

HADES and GAIA don't have genders in the wiki, but they note HADES has a male programmed voice and GAIA a female programmed voice and female holographic appearance. I've coded male and female accordingly - I suspect they read to the player as gendered. 

Couldn't find "Greeting Nora Child" "Greeting Young Nora Hunter" in the videos, so labelled neutral. 

For reference: Tutorial on flashpoints (emotional choices) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoXiKE8uTo8 19:00. 

Janeva's dialogue does not feature in the data source. However:
https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Janeva: "Janeva's gender is not stated. Given that they insist to Aloy that they are "not one of [her] sisters", it is possible that they are either trans-masculine, nonbinary, or merely prefers pronouns opposite to their birth gender. However Janeva has not stated any pronouns."


The Counselor dialogue seems to be two characters, one male, one female.
