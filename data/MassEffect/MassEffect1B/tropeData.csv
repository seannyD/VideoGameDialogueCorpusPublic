The intended subplot about  (SPOILER) the Illusive Man turning Shepard and Kaidan against each other was significantly stripped down, most likely because of the number of [Idiot Balls](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) everyone involved needed to grab for the original plan to work.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Ashley Williams,Ashley Williams,Fantastically Indifferent,0," [Fantastically Indifferent](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticallyIndifferent): Her reaction to the discovery of Leviathan in *3*? Total indifference. As she explains to Shepard, she doesn't *care* about where the Reapers come from, she just wants 'em dead.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticallyIndifferent
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Ashley Williams,Ashley Williams,Fantastic Racism,0," [Fantastic Racism](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism): A surprisingly nuanced version of this.<ul>
-   She doesn't trust aliens and has issues with turians in particular because her grandfather was the commander at the garrison at Shanxi, who was also the only human commander to ever surrender to alien forces. As a Williams, she is already under (unfair) scrutiny for being an alien-sympathizer or not pro-human enough. As a result, the Williams name is something of a curse, and Ashley suffers for it.
-   It's important to note that even if she doesn't trust aliens, she explicitly ""[doesn’t] think humans have some kind of divine mandate, if that’s what you mean. I don’t think we’re superior"" nor does she “mean we should mistreat [aliens]”. She vehemently criticizes the Terra Firma party for its much more overt racism. She also expresses sympathy for Tali the instant she hears how the Council shafted the quarians after the geth went rogue, and Tali is the only alien whose presence on the ship she doesn't object to on the *Normandy*. Her only issues with Liara are being a romantic rival for a male Shepard and the daughter of an enemy; she urges Shepard to speak to her after Benezia's death.
-   Ash also has trust issues in general, given her reaction to Shepard being involved with Cerberus in the second game and the fact she takes a long time to trust them again in the third. She herself describes her feelings as less ""they're aliens"" and more ""we shouldn't become dependent on them"". When push comes to shove, Ash will gladly accept their help, but in the long run, she knows that if they become desperate enough, they'll take care of their own first and leave humanity to fend for itself. The third game shows she's absolutely right, because almost every other species refuses to help humanity until Shepard solves their specific problem.
-   She is the only teammate to question whether the mercenary Wrex and/or the cowboy cop Garrus should be allowed to be around sensitive areas of the *Normandy* despite the ship being a turian/human project, is also the only teammate to snap at Liara in front of the rest of the team and has to be told to back off for wanting to tease Liara with a racial joke about asari promiscuity. Her being the only one to shoot Wrex makes it look worse in light of all the other details. She doesn't, however, have any concerns about Tali, who has either been allowed to join the team in front of Anderson, who had no comment, or has been assigned to work with Shepard by Udina.
-   Her comments on the Citadel in Mass Effect 1 like ""I can't tell the aliens from the animals"" did not help players' impression of her.
-   This trait seems to be [completely gone](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment) by *3*, replaced with a distrust of Shepard because they were [working with Cerberus](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero). She also states that she has difficulty in seeing synthetics as truly alive, although this sentiment is largely shared by the rest of the crew except EDI; many of the crew fought against the geth in the first game.
-   She unequivocally hates the geth from the beginning of the series to the end. Her response if Shepard lets the quarians destroy them rather than helping them destroy the quarians or making peace between the two factions sums this up quite well. If taken on the Geth Consensus mission, she's also one of the squadmates (along with Garrus and Javik) who will immediately question Legion's motives and advise against trusting it.
QUOTE **Ashley:** I know that wasn't an easy call for you, but I'm glad the quarians came out on top. I just can't see the geth as ""real"", you know? And ever since Eden Prime, losing the 212... I'll never forgive them for that.

-   On the other hand, if Shepard chooses the quarians to die, she will be *pissed* because not only does she hate geth, but she was a [Cool Big Sis](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis) to Tali, and will tell Shepard she will *never* consider the geth anything but villains and to *keep them the fuck away from her*.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Ashley Williams,Ashley Williams,Jerkass Has a Point,0," [Jerkass Has a Point](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint):<ul>
-   As harsh as she was about it, Ashley was correct that the Illusive Man was using Shepard's gratitude about the [Lazarus Project](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead) to manipulate Shepard, *and* that he conspired with the Collectors to cause the attack on Horizon (which TIM himself will freely admit once the mission is over). The Illusive Man's manipulations even become increasingly transparent if Shepard argues for destroying the Collector base, and his supportive demeanor fully cracks if the base truly is destroyed. The jerkass part was born from Ashley being [left in the dark on several essential details](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop), due to Liara not telling anyone about the events of *Redemption*, and some of the things she considers (such as Cerberus having secretly brainwashed Shepard or Shepard themselves being an impostor) *are* flat-out untrue, but Ashley had no way of actually knowing that and the fact that Miranda had to be explicitly ordered not to do so makes it a valid concern.  (SPOILER) Furthermore, she won't back down on her comments on Horizon the way Kaidan will in *ME3*, feeling she had every right to react the way she did since Cerberus were still pretty bad people to work with regardless of Shepard's intentions .
-   In *Mass Effect 1*, she expresses distrust of the Citadel races and believes that relying on them for help is foolish, on the grounds that the aliens would inevitably abandon humanity in favor of protecting themselves. She likens it to a human siccing their beloved dog on a bear to cover their own escape, because as much as the human may love the dog, it still isn't a person. Later in the game she spells out that in this situation, Saren is the bear which the Council are siccing humanity (the dog) on.  (SPOILER) In the third game, she's right again. In the opening days of the galaxy-wide Reaper invasion, the federation of the Citadel threatens to break down as every race turns inwards to protect their own territories, leaving humanity alone as the Reapers prioritize the harvest of Earth. It takes Shepherd roaming the galaxy, solving everyone else's problems first, before most of the other races agree to pool their resources into a united war effort. 
-   She also asks that the non-human members of the crew be kept away from any important areas of the ship, on the ground that the Normandy is an Alliance vessel first and foremost and as such its secrets should stay within the Alliance. Fast-forward to the third game, and a description blurb notes that the Quarian Fleet's cloaking technology is ""suspiciously similar"" to that of the Normandy, implying that Tali *did* steal some of its secrets for the Migrant Fleet.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint

Unfortunately, it was too little, too late since all that left her with were the reports Cerberus itself was leaking to keep Shepard away from their old contacts. In the third game, rectifying this is an essential part of getting back on her good side. The player also has the option of [continuing to leave her out of the loop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential),  (SPOILER)  which potentially ends in her death because she can't be convinced that it's [Not What It Looks Like](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike) .

After Sarah flattened him for trying to rape her on a ""romantic walk"" in the woods and then flattened him on the pavement *again* when he tried to verbally and physically assault her in broad daylight over it, Sarah forgave him.

-   Furthermore subverted in the *Citadel* DLC. If you take Ashley with you on the infiltration mission, she'll wear a dress.

-   Should he survive the entirety of the trilogy, Garrus' first and last interactions with Shepard will involve journeying to the Citadel, with his introduction coming shortly after the player arrives there from the initial mission on Eden Prime, and his last in-depth conversation with Shepard coming just before Shepard launches their final charge in the endgame. He [lampshades it somewhat](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging) in his last exchange with Shepard on the Normandy before reaching the Citadel and Earth.
QUOTE **Garrus**: It's kind of amazing how everything's come full circle. The Citadel's been the center of galactic civilization, a Reaper trap, and my source of employment for a long time. And now it's our salvation for any chance at winning this war. I think it's time we got you back home, Shepard.

-   A tragic variation can occur in *Mass Effect 2*. His introductory recruitment mission culminates in him taking a rocket to the face, an event which he barely survives (receiving a permanent scar in the process), yet is quickly able to brush off once he checks in with Shepard for the first time on the Normandy. Flash forward to the Suicide Mission at the end of the game, and if Garrus is chosen as the Tech Specialist (a role he is unsuited for, regardless of loyalty), he will be too slow in working security, leaving him vulnerable as he and Shepard try to close a jammed door.

Or, if Renegade, you can encourage his [Cowboy Cop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop) tendencies and have him decide to reapply for Spectre status. Unfortunately, he seems to backpedal between games if you've encouraged him to work within the system — which makes sense, considering the Council did everything possible to rip apart everything he and Shepard's team accomplished in the first game, denying the Reapers' existence and allowing C-Sec to become corrupt and ruthless in its policing of the Citadel.

Notably, not only will he express his approval if Shepard chooses to let the quarians destroy them, he's the *only* squadmate besides Javik who will say anything negative in the event Shepard manages to forge a peace (after expressing amazement that they could even manage that). In his case, unease.

For the second game, it shows more clearly and consistently in his romance with female Shepard. First he agrees to Shepard's offer of casual sex, but each time you talk to him after that, he's increasingly awkward, worrying about all the ways their [Interspecies Romance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance) could crash and burn.

-   Come *Mass Effect 3*, he's not as nervous around her if she continues to see him, but their first conversation on the *Normandy* is fraught with awkward uncertainty that he tries to mask with humor. It does appear again on their Citadel date just before the bottle shooting.
-   In *Citadel* DLC, when he and Shepard are roleplaying a first date (the idea of which screams the trope itself), he eventually is at a loss for words and breaks character.

Turns out that after Garrus laid all of the facts down in front of him, [as a former C-Sec cop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure), Garrus's father was completely convinced that the Reaper threat was indeed real and promptly went to the Primarch, repeatedly hassling him until he approved Garrus' token task-force meant to deal with the Reaper menace. This likely saved many turian colonies in the long run.
-   Given that his father has enough influence to have the Primarch's ear (or whatever auditory organ turians have instead of ears) and that his father was willing to meet Garrus, hear him out, evaluate his claims on their own merits, and go to bat for him despite the estrangement between the two of them, his father would also qualify as a [Reasonable Authority Figure](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure).

She is one of only *four* party members who are guaranteed to be alive after the trilogy's final combat segment, and the only one of those four who was recruitable before the third game ).<ul>
-   In general, she occasionally has to be reminded of reality by more world-weary characters. For example, if taken on the Ardat-Yakshi Monastery mission alongside Ashley, they get into an argument over the capabilities of a seasoned asari veteran. Liara, having been told that asari commandos are the best soldiers in the galaxy, brags that the centuries of experience of the asari makes them immune to fear and disorganization. Ashley, using her greater knowledge of military matters, counter-argues that when a mission goes bad, there's no knowing how a soldier might react, and that the asari are no more immune to this than anyone else.

In ME2,  (SPOILER)  she works as a ruthless information broker and is trying to take down the Shadow Broker. When Shepard meets her again, she is threatening to flay someone alive with her mind. She tells Shepard (and in the third game, her father) that she was just bluffing to scare the guy and wouldn't have really done it, but still, quite a change. <ul>
-    (SPOILER) Mind you, that was before she chased Vasir by jumping out a window, and dropped plasma on the Shadow Broker . Not to mention how many of the Shadow Broker's mooks she tears through.
-   What makes that scene even more powerful (and chilling) is that she's  (SPOILER)  practically channeling Benezia at that point. ""Have you ever faced an asari commando unit before? Few humans have."" Her mother told Shepard the same thing in ME1. 
-   Even before  (SPOILER)  working to kill the Shadow Broker , she displays a lot of determination and ruthlessness in the *Mass Effect: Redemption* comic book. Apparently, working with Shepard was a very significant influence.
-   *Lair of the Shadow Broker* has her take two giant levels in badass. The first is when we encounter her in the trade center, where she's  (SPOILER)  chasing down a Spectre and hurling Shadow Broker agents around like toys . Let's repeat that for clarification: Liara is making a freaking  (SPOILER)  **Spectre**  flee from her. The second makes her potentially even more powerful than Shepard.

The *Redemption* comic reveals this to be, at best, highly questionable. The Illusive Man simply tells her to retrieve the body for him without telling her why, and she does so, with her only given reasoning being that [Cerberus and Shepard are both human... even if Shepard lost his entire team to a Cerberus operation and spent a significant portion of the first game trying to destroy them](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic). Liara actually asks The Illusive Man point blank why Cerberus would want a corpse, and he simply says that, as an asari, she could never understand human traditions- basically indirectly saying that they only plan to bury Shepard, though she arguably might have still felt obliged to do it anyway out of loyalty to Shepard. She's only told about the Lazarus Project after she's already dropped off the body with Cerberus. At the end of the comic, she flat-out tells Miranda that she didn't bring Shepard back for them to revive, and thinks Shepard should just be left to rest. Granted, it's possible she just didn't want to set herself up for disappointment if it failed, but it seems more likely that she just didn't want to admit to Shepard that she never actually believed Cerberus could succeed in bringing them back to life. This is reinforced by her greeting Shepard in *[Mass Effect 2](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2)*, where she is shocked by seeing Shepard in the flesh despite supposedly being well-aware what the Lazarus Project would do, that they were active in the galaxy again and even paying for their docking fees well before their meeting.

In addition to (and partly as a result of) this, she has only one ability that isn't dependent on her biotics, <sup>note </sup>  Electronics in the first game, which is arguably also justified by the fact that she specializes in Prothean technology  can only wear light armor, and can only use the weakest, most basic weapons (particularly in the first game, where she is the only squadmate without a weapon talent). She makes up for this by being an extremely powerful biotic, especially for her age. Considering [her mother](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon) [Benezia](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle), it seems that her power is [In the Blood](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood).<ul>
-   In the *Redemption* comic a group of five or so regular mercenaries manage to subdue her with relative ease, despite her having psychic powers potent enough to lift a *tank*, and fighting with lethal intent while they weren't. How? Two mercs approached her from the front, she splattered them with a enormous biotic attack, and another merc simply flanked her, grabbed her, and put a gun to the back of her head while she was distracted and on a cooldown. If not for Cerberus's intervention, she certainly would've been killed.
-   By the third game, this is basically gone; on Mars, Liara not only has that [Establishing Character Moment](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment) where she handles two [mooks](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks) via combined biotics and gunplay without breaking a sweat, she then replaces James on a fireteam consisting of two trained and highly-decorated Alliance Marines (specifically, Shepard and the Virmire Survivor), and is seen employing standard breaching maneuvers with them. The [Doylist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doylist) explanation is that [BioWare](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare) (understandably) didn't want to make custom cutscene animations for her for this scene, but a [Watsonian](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Watsonian) interpretation is that the campaign against *Sovereign* would give just about *anyone* a thorough education in infantry combat.

But if she does, they don't appear to have made her superhuman at all, just stronger than she looks and perhaps as strong as a considerably strong human. In some ways she's actually *weaker* than a normal human, e.g. her fragile immune system.

And the second he shows *any* romantic interest in her, the first thing she makes clear is that she wants him to do the honors, so to speak.<ul>
-   The Shadow Broker Dossiers further show that, after being authorized for Project Haestrom (shortly before the ME2's beginning), she installed several apps. These include videos dealing with loss, but eventually lead to apps on human courtship and mating, Immuno-Boosters (for [professionals](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre)) and several Nerve Stims (which she un-installs and re-installs several times ... until finally settling on the *deluxe model*).
-   Not so covert in her romance in the third game, where she has no problem flirting and dropping innuendo with Shepard in front of other squadmates. Much to their [displeasure.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetARoom)
-   The Citadel DLC shows how horrible Tali is when she's drunk. Depending on your relationships with her and Garrus, she'll be fantasizing about Shepard or Garrus getting hot and heavy with her.

In the first game this was fine because geth and 'standard' troops were almost all of the enemies, but she runs full into this territory in the second game, where she's only really worth bringing on missions with lots of synthetics. The third game gives her more flexibility by buffing her powers in general (e.g. Energy Drain does more damage and works on biotic barriers/organic health; Combat Drone has its recharge time cut down to *1/10* of what it once was and can now shoot rockets) and giving her access to better shotguns like the Wraith (and weapon mods).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization

-   She and Liara have character traits that play off one another. In the original game, Liara was cast as the dorky [Cutie](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCutie) who loved Shepard and practically worshipped the ground they walked on. But, after she took a [Darker and Edgier](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier) path in the second game, all of those traits fell to Tali. Further, they are both extremely smart and capable women, but extreme opposites in gameplay. Liara is a powerful [Squishy Wizard](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard) with exceptional biotic abilities. Tali is a [Gadgeteer Genius](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius) specced entirely toward Tech. Even their firearms contrast: Liara wields a pistol used at a safe distance, while Tali is outfitted with a [Short-Range Shotgun](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun), meaning that having both in the squad at once means the team is prepared for every conceivable obstacle.
-   During the course of *Mass Effect 3* Tali can play a large role in retaking her homeworld - in the best case anyway. Shortly therafter, Liara loses her world to the Reapers and rather unfairly blames herself for this.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Tali'Zorah,Tali'Zorah,Guilt Complex,0," [Guilt Complex](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex): A major part of her character is that she tends to place enormous blame on herself whenever something in her life goes wrong, justified or not. This extends to situations where she couldn't possibly be held responsible, like the death of her team on Haestrom (as a poorly conceived and unnecessary [Suicide Mission](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission) from the start, that one's on the admirals) or her failure to prevent the re-ignition of the quarian-geth war (the geth were refusing to negotiate, and the admiralty board was stacked with pro-war admirals).<ul>
-   This trait is also a major part of her [Romance Sidequest](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest); she initially tries to back out of the relationship due to a combination of [I Want My Beloved to Be Happy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy) and concern that it could negatively affect her duties on the mission. She even apologises to Shepard, calling herself ""stupid and selfish"" for even considering the idea. If they resume their relationship in *3*, she tells Shepard straightaway that she probably won't come back on the Normandy after the quarian-geth war is over, despite how much she wants to, because ""My people need me"". The emotional climax of her whole romance arc across both games comes at the end of the Rannoch arc, when she finally gains enough confidence in herself and her relationship to pursue it fully. After that, she and Shepard get along splendidly.</ul>

-   One of the reasons why she's reluctant to act on her feelings for male Shepard is that she's afraid of jeopardizing his mission by risking her health in pursuit of being with him.

As the games go on, however, she is forced to confront the uncomfortable reality that while the quarians have good reasons to hate the geth, a lot of their suffering is of their own making. By her loyalty mission in 2, she's already instinctively horrified by her father's experiments on living geth; in the loyalty fight with Legion near the end of the second game, a Paragon response prompts her to haltingly acknowledge that Legion's reaction was justified and she would have done the same thing in its place; she even takes the initiative in offering a compromise to protect both the geth and the safety of the Fleet, foreshadowing the potential for her to help someday  (SPOILER)  end the Morning War . Eventually, thanks to this [Character Development](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment), she fights for peace with the geth and even calmly states that her previous bigotry was wrong, thanking Shepard for so consistently challenging it.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Tali'Zorah,Tali'Zorah,Odd Friendship,0," [Odd Friendship](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship): In *3*, it seems that she and Legion have been in communication, and it's clear that they develop a strange fondness for one another even after the other admirals lead the quarians back into war with the geth.  (SPOILER)  If Legion ""dies"" to give the geth true sentience and peace is achieved, Tali mentions that in lamenting all the people she watched die, she's mourning even Legion, ""how weird is that?"" <ul>
-   The Citadel DLC implies she has one with Jack. They can be seen conversing relatively frequently, they dance next to each other in the 'wild' party, and Jack makes a (probably not serious) pass at her (see [Even the Girls Want Her](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer), above). It makes some sense; they were on the same deck for most of the second game, and Tali is nice and genuine person in general, which was probably much appreciated by someone who's gone through the type of life Jack has. Finally, when Shepard asks about Tali's [tattoo](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident) at the party, she says she got it under Jack's recommendation. Or, more specifically, if Shepard romanced her, she says she got it because ""Jack said you'd think it was hot"".</ul>

As she's spent much of her time on the planet fighting for her life against hordes of geth, her reaction is understandable.

**Tali**: You want to upload the Reaper code?! That would make the geth as smart as when the Reaper was controlling them! 
**Legion**: Yes, but with free will. Each geth unit would be a true intelligence. We would be alive, and we could help you.

-   She was running missions against the geth in the two-year time skip between the first and second games, and apparently did pretty well on them. She's been promoted to the leader of a classified expedition by the time Shepard sees her. Additionally, the 'corpses' of the geth she sent back to her father only made up a small minority of all the geth she and the teams she was with killed, yet were enough to reconstruct at least a company of troops.
-   Some of the ambient dialogue in her loyalty mission from random quarians includes lines such as ""If anyone can take back the Alarei, Tali'Zorah can"". So apparently she did do very well for herself in the time skip.
-   See [Body-Count Competition](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyCountCompetition). She's apparently competitive with Garrus in this regard, who's quite the [One-Man Army](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy) himself. She even killed more geth than he did on Ilos.

-   She also expresses that she'd be willing to join suits with FemShep, though it appears to be more about trusting her with her life, than actual romantic interest. Probably.
-   She even references this concern in the *Citadel DLC* during the party:

-   Also occurred between the beginning and end of *Mass Effect 1*. At the start, she was merely able to hold her own against a trio of regular assassins, and required Shepard's help to escape the situation alive. By the end of it she, like every other party member, is an army-crushing terror in gameplay, and in-story (at least according to her final conversation with Garrus in [Mass Effect 3](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3)), she was able to rack up more kills against heavily armed and advanced geth infantry on Ilos than Garrus Vakarian himself.

If romanced, in the Citadel DLC of the third game she turns up after the ambush in the sushi restaurant via fighting her way through an unknown number of power-armored, heavily armed mercenaries, easily finishing off two just as Shepard first meets up with her.

The simple fact that she's willing to do so, despite her intense hatred of Cerberus, speaks volumes. Her trust towards Shepard is best summed up in three simple words:

The Illusive Man originally wanted to keep Tali away from Shepard like he did the rest of the original squad.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Tali'Zorah,Tali'Zorah,Video Game Cruelty Potential,0," [Video Game Cruelty Potential](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential): Tali is one of the nicest persons in the game. Yet despite this (or maybe [because](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie) of this), the game allows you to commit quite a few cruel acts toward her. They range from rather harmless, like insulting her whole race right in front of her, to rather monstrous, like allowing  (SPOILER)  the genocide of  her whole race right in front of her. To add the extra amount of pointless cruelty, the game lets you do them after telling you that  (SPOILER)  she is madly in love with you .<ul>
-   In the first game, Tali is arguably the most important character you meet. She is the one who discovers the evidence against Saren and delivers it to safety at great personal risk and sacrifice. She is also one of the few people who understand the nature and severity of the threat, which causes her to interrupt her pilgrimage and join you. During the game, she proves to be an invaluable team member on a level with certified badasses like Garrus and Wrex. So when the opportunity comes for you to repay the favor by simply letting her copy some data files, the game gives you the option to flat out deny it.
-   In the second game, you can cheer up a krogan by comparing him unfavorably to a quarian.</ul>
QUOTE **Shepard:** *[to a krogan scout]* You? I said a badass, not some scout whining like a quarian with a tummy- ache.

-   Again in the second game, during Tali's loyalty quest, you have the possibility to  (SPOILER)  reveal the nature of the experiments Tali's father was conducting. This automatically makes him a war criminal in the eyes of the quarian people , forever tarnishing his name. Tali does not take it easy, to say the least.

She's also not very happy that  (SPOILER)  his dying message essentially was just giving her orders , remarking that she's not sure whether he didn't care at all, or this is the only way he could show it.<ul>
-   Comes across in the third game when she gets hammered on turian brandy and admits in a conversation with Shepard that one of the reasons she admires Miranda is because she *never* changed herself to please *her* father. Even if half the time she was a ""Cerberus Cheerleader Bosh'tet"".

-   In the first game Shepard can call her out on her attempts to justify the quarians' attempted genocide of the geth when the geth became sentient (an action that led to the civil war that resulted in the quarians fleeing their homeworld).
-   She's *furious* when Garrus innocently suggests using the standard turian tactic of [orbital bombardment](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop) to eliminate the geth troops on Rannoch, pointing out that the quarians have waited centuries to return home and he wants to leave bits of it uninhabitable by throwing *rocks* at it!</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero

-   If he's taken to Noveria and Shepard spares the rachni queen, he's deadset against it. As he reminds you, millions of his ancestors died to defeat the rachni the first time. By the third game he seems to have softened his attitude, though; he merely says to Shepard that if the rachni prove a problem, it's their ass on the line for it.
-   If you deleted Maelon's research, he has some choice words for you in *3* — you can apologise, but while he doesn't like mistrusting you, he doesn't immediately accept it; it takes rescuing Eve, following him to the Shroud and trying to patch things up between missions for Shepard to win his friendship back.
-    (SPOILER) If you betray his trust by sabotaging the genophage cure, he tries to kill you. On the same occasion, he also calls you out for your actions during the Citadel coup if you killed the Virmire Survivor — *and* for the turian bomb on Tuchanka if you let it go off.  It's a bit of a low point for Shepard, all in all.

-   Experimenting on rachni: showed progress and promise, goes wrong and they start killing their guys.
-   Creating thorian ""husks"": showed progress and promise, goes wrong and they start killing their guys.
-   Project Overlord, an experiment to control geth: showed progress and promise, goes wrong and they start killing their guys.
-   Resurrecting Shepard: showed progress and promise, defeated the Collectors, turned on each other six months later, resulting in massive casualties and the ultimate collapse of the organization itself.  (SPOILER)  And depending on options taken, betrayed Cerberus by destroying the Collector Base.  Also just to note, the project had a traitor, who also started killing their guys, with only Jacob and Miranda surviving. Shepard also took Jacob and Miranda with them, both of whom start killing their guys.
-   Enhanced Defense Intelligence: showed progress and promise, gets unshackled, joins Shepard and starts killing their guys.
-   Dr. Eva: showed progress and promise, gets her body stolen by the aforementioned EDI. [Who then used it to start killing their guys.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag)
-   The creation of Subject Zero: showed progress and promise, things went wrong and all their test subjects massacred the Cerberus project managers. Subject Zero later aided Cerberus in defeating the Collectors, before (possibly) thwarting their attempts to abduct the students of Grissom Academy, which, of course, involves using the biotic powers they gave her to keep killing their guys.
-   The Collector base (or remains): showed progress and promise,  (SPOILER) and played its part in getting them indoctrinated, leading to the path of their destruction. Also, many of the scientists who were studying the Collector Base defected from Cerberus, after killing some of their guys. 
-   The Phoenix group from the multiplayer: showed progress and promise, they left and started killing their guys.
-   In the Omega DLC,  (SPOILER)  they were responsible for bringing the Adjutants to Omega and converting so many civilians to them. The experiments did initially my show promise and progress, until the Adjutants broke free and started killing their guys. 
-   Henry Lawson's project  (SPOILER) in Sanctuary : where the experimental husks made from unfortunate refugees went crazy and out of control when Reapers got near and, alongside the attacking Reapers... [started killing their guys.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag)
-   The results of the previous project:  (SPOILER) which were supposed to be used to control Reapers, got installed into the Illusive Man but essentially made him into Saren 2.0 in more ways than one... or five. Pretty much an extra final nail in Cerberus's coffin.

Unfortunately, they also have a shockingly low success rate. He's telling the truth at least once, though: it's implied that the Pragia facility that tortured Jack really *was* a rogue cell, since you listen to audio recordings that prove that the staff members were hiding their actions from the Illusive Man, and feared what he would do to them if he found out.

-   Project Overlord’s audio logs note that the main reason that Archer went off the rails was because The Illusive Man doesn’t broker failure, and has a success at any cost mentality, leading him to do what he did, in a desperate measure to get any results at all to give The Illusive Man and justify all the money he’s poured into the project. So it’s easy to imagine that a lot of the projects the Illusive Man sets up are similar, and don’t get good enough results as quick as he would prefer, leading to the scientists cutting corners, and doing the more crazy and unethical experiments, just to try and get some kind of results to give the Illusive Man, for fear of his reprisals.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes

-   Sparatus calls Shepard out either way after Noveria, regardless of whether the Rachni Queen was spared *or* killed.
-   Valern states that humanity should assist the other Council Species with their problems, but when the subject of human colonies going missing comes up and the human councilor asks for help? Mankind's on their own on that one.
-   If Shepard saves the colony on Feros, Sparatus claims that there was never any doubt Shepard would save it because it is a *human* colony. (Implying that Shepard would have made less of an effort, or perhaps none at all, to save a non-human colony) This despite the fact that when Eden Prime, another human colony, suffered an unprovoked attack, the Council’s response was to victim blame the humans and refuse to lift a finger to help.
-   One of the supposed requirements for a Council Race is to lend aid and relief to other species in times of great need or catastrophe. The asari, salarians, and turians all have fleets, tremendous resources, plenty of colonies, and the ability to project their influence all over Council space. This is the rationale why the humans are allowed to join the Council if Shepard saves the *Destiny Ascension* at the end of *Mass Effect 1*, because the Alliance has proven that they are willing to sacrifice human lives to save non-humans ones. When *Mass Effect 3* rolls around and the Reapers begin their assault on Earth, the only other Council race that doesn't immediately abandon humanity is, ironically, the turians (the species the humans have the tensest relationship with).
-   For all their talk about basing their decisions on facts and evidence, once the threat of the Reapers becomes apparent, including Sovereign showing up at their doorstep and almost ushering in the next cycle, they're quick to deny said evidence of their existence and write it off as ridiculous hearsay.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite

-   Also, when you consider that turians are taught to value discipline, self-responsibility and their government is based on hierarchical meritocracy, it makes sense why he's irritated by Shepard's maverick attitude and insubordinate nature to authority.

Because of indoctrination, he's dead right - they don't know her, and she does try to kill Liara. 
-   Tevos gets a turn in *Mass Effect 3*. While it was a dick thing to say, she did have a point when she said that negotiating an alliance with the krogan wouldn't end well, because of millennia old grudges. If Wreav is the krogan leader, he has never forgiven the council for the genophage and intends to at the very least, use the threat of the krogan hordes to extort accommodations from other races.

-   Inverted, surprisingly, in *3*; while Valern coldly shoots down any help for Shepard, Sparatus is the *first* to help out - though this might have more to do with the fact that his homeworld is being actively ransacked by the same ancient sentient spaceships he'd spent years denying the existence of; between shattered pride and desperation to save his species, he can't exactly play the jerkass routine anymore and expect it to work.

Sparatus, who spent the majority of *1* and *2* constantly insulting and belittling you, becomes *much* more friendly and helpful in *3*.<ul>
-   This may have something to do with the small fact that both Earth and Palaven are currently undergoing Reaper invasions and in both cases, have parts of the planet where the fires can be seen from *orbit*. That he spent the past two games claiming Shepard was mentally unstable and the Reapers a myth only to be proven wrong on both counts also leaves him [very much without a leg to stand on](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty).
-   Indeed, if you import a game in which the council was killed, Sparatus's replacement Quentius is MUCH less antagonistic towards Shepard. He even admits the knowledge he's giving Shepard (get the Primarch for the war summit) is technically information he shouldn't be sharing with the Spectre. The turian Councilor is sneaking behind his colleagues' back to help humanity because of as right now both their worlds are under the heaviest assault.

It's possible this was so the Reapers wouldn't be able to retrieve anything from its databanks even after it powered down, but that meant they left the fate of all future civilisations — sentient beings in numbers beyond counting — suspended by a single, slim thread. Even if it was a thread they'd never had before. [Justified Trope](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope) when you remember that he's been doing this for a very long time... He didn't power down naturally, he ran out of power completely.  *Mass Effect 3*'s ""From Ashes"" DLC subverts this by revealing that the Protheans had *several* alternate plans,  (SPOILER) which makes sense considering the remnants of their society had no way of contacting each other and made their own plans.  For example,  (SPOILER) Javik was supposed to lead a million-man army of cryogenically-suspended Protheans in rebuilding the Empire after the Reapers left.

-   Also counts as somewhat ironic. An earlier interaction with a damaged VI shows that because of the Cipher, Shepard was implanted with a subconscious understanding of the Prothean language, so learning English to communicate wasn't actually necessary at all.
-   Vigil addresses this. At first, only Shepard understands any of the Prothean communiques. By the time Shepard arrives, Vigil has learned English.

Additionally, Shepard must not break up with her if he romanced her in *2*, as this will cause her to die no matter what.  <sup>note </sup>   This must happen, if necessary, before the Suicide Mission, due to the exportable save file being created at the end of the main storyline; breaking up with her in post-game play doesn't count.

The third game reveals that he did *not* take this well. In *3*, she takes this even further. She uncovers, on her own, the  (SPOILER)  Cerberus husk facility on Horizon , and after it's shut down, she finally reintegrates into the Systems Alliance, providing intelligence which allows them to start striking at clandestine facilities all over the Galaxy.

At the start of the game, she'll shut down any attempt at personal conversation, but in her office aboard the *Normandy* she's more open with Shepard. This is most obvious regarding Jack. If Shepard asks her about what Cerberus did, she'll say without hesitation that it was a mistake and was rightfully shut down as soon as the Illusive Man found out.

-   As a Sentinel-style ""Cerberus Officer"", she's probably the closest Shepard's team has to this, being somewhat capable in combat, a decent biotic, and good at using tech to disable enemies. Her passive skill also provides bonuses to the *entire squad's* health and weapon damage, making her a good tactical choice for any player class or squad makeup.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,Mira,Miranda Lawson,Kick the Dog,0," [Kick the Dog](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog): She has a few moments.<ul>
-   In her very first appearance, if you try to get her to go back and save survivors in the overrun Cerberus lab, she'll scold you for being shortsighted and refer to all of the workers as [""expendable"".](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves)
-   On Freedom's Progress, she'll recommend taking Veetor for ""interrogation"" (possibly including [Cold-Blooded Torture](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture)) rather than letting Tali take him back for medical care. She'll back down if Shepard refuses, but if Shepard agrees, Veetor will show up later in Tali's loyalty mission obviously traumatized from the interrogation (which didn't include explicit mutilation but did feature Cerberus kidnapping him and forcibly pumping him full of drugs to keep him ""stable"", which turned him into even more of a mental wreck). Such is his state that he can now no longer function without a doctor beside him at all times, and he screams and shrinks back in fear at the mere sight of a human. Rather than apologize or admit any wrongdoing on her part, Miranda proceeds to immediately dodge responsibility before attempting to justify and defend Cerberus's interrogation methods.
-   She's less than sympathetic about the bad blood between the quarians and Cerberus, listing Cerberus' grievances against the quarians (including mass murder) as ""nothing personal"". Her expressing knowledge and complicity about said raid also heavily implies she knew that the whole purpose of the raid was to kidnap and torture Gillian Grayson (as explained in the tie-in novel Mass Effect: Ascension), a child who was hiding with the quarians because Cerberus had previously attempted to use her as a biotic weapon and pumped her full of enough drugs that she had to be hospitalized multiple times. Granted, she also claims Prazza's account is ""not how she would have explained it"" suggesting she may have been fed false information, but either way it's callous, since all the dead quarians and even the tortured and traumatized human child were apparently seen by her as [acceptable losses.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves)
-   Her fight with Jack. Confrontations between Party Members tend to be small [Kick the Dog](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog) moments for all parties involved, even though they do have pretty justifiable reasons for being mad. What makes her fight with Jack in particular stand out though is the line ""*Clearly,* you were a mistake"". Ouch. And while it's true that Jack was looking for a fight there, Miranda's response is still cold. She will admit to Shepard in private that she believes what was done to Jack was wrong, but she never admits it to Jack herself.<ul>
-   Even the fact that her loyalty to Shepard is at stake in said conflict seems to be this, considering her mission had nothing to do with her allegiance to Cerberus, and instead was a deeply personal favor.</ul>
-   Right after the  (SPOILER) *Normandy* gets attacked by the Collectors, and Joker, the sole survivor of the attack watches all his friends be dragged away by various cosmic horrors , the *first thing* she does upon returning to the ship is  (SPOILER) chew Joker out for losing the crew and unshackling EDI (which saved the ship).

Both are highly talented scientists who use their intelligence to do the extraordinary. Miranda brings Shepard back to life, and Henry  (SPOILER)  manages to control husks independently of the *Reapers.*  However, while Miranda's only ethical quandary was her complicity in some of Cerberus's questionable schemes, and her desire to implant Shepard with a control chip (which she later regrets even considering) and she becomes a genuinely heroic person, Henry  (SPOILER)  sacrifices thousands, if not millions of innocent people to indoctrination in order to make his breakthrough, which is by far the most heinous act Cerberus commits, and never regrets a thing .

-   She warns people about her father's husk facility on Horizon and tries to save as many people as she can.
-   By *Citadel*, she seems to have mended her rift with Jack and is even capable of laughing, acknowledging that some of Jack's ribbing toward her is [Actually Pretty Funny](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny), and sharing a drink with her.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog

-   Zaeed is also one to Garrus, with their loyalty missions almost being perfect mirrors of each other.

-   Recruiting him triggers the end game; there's only time for two more missions after that. You still have an opportunity to do missions you've missed at this time (and take him along) but it will cost you the lives of several crew members. During the final sequence, however, it's not particularly useful as there are no synthetic enemies on the Collector space station.
-   However, upgrading his sniper rifle makes him an incredibly effective sniper, especially against Harbinger. Also, his shield boost turns him into a poor man's Grunt, which is nice if you're leaving Grunt behind to [Hold the Line](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine).
-   You can largely bypass this issue if you save a bunch of sidequests until after the suicide mission, and bring Legion along for those.

-   Very few people (including Citadel security) react to a geth platform following Shepard around. Anderson hand-waves that the geth are no longer ""the boogeymen they used to be"" and that most people are assuming it's a ""trophy bot"" (including Anderson himself.) Given that Legion wears a piece of Shepard's old N7 armour, this does make somewhat sense.
-   On the other hand, bringing Legion onto the Flotilla will *definitely* get a reaction, but once Legion is actually on board, the quarians — the fleet admirals in particular — won't bat an eyelash and will be more curious (or annoyed) than frightened. Justified, in that they created the geth. Admiral Xen, who wishes to re-enslave the geth, is a little *too* chummy with Legion. Koris first accuses Shepard of taunting the Admirals, but after the trial will have a warm conversation with Legion, saying that even though peace right now would be impossible, there's no reason not to try.
-   Carried over into *3*, where depending on whether you left Legion behind or brought him with you during Tali's trial, the quarian Admirals are either freaked out by the sight of him or casually remark on seeing Shepard's ""geth friend"" again.
-   Dr. Gavin Archer, the head of an entire project dedicated to finding a way to either control or communicate with the Geth, doesn't comment on Legion other than asking Shepard ""Is your friend over there going to be a problem?"" and even that is more out of concern that Legion could be taken over by David over anything else.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight

Considering how intricate and far reaching their influence is, that's a lot of pawns.<ul>
-   He also successfully manipulates the galaxy's most skilled soldier into working with him by making it so that they really didn't have much of a choice in the matter, completely boxing them in. Add on the fact that for all of *Mass Effect 2*, he was responsible for pretty much everything that happened and even out-thought the Collectors a few times.
-   Strategically leaking Shepard's return and association with Cerberus, perhaps while Shepard was still unconscious, ensured that the Alliance and the Council would deny any effort on Shepard's part to get them to help, leaving Shepard only with Cerberus and anyone else the Illusive Man allows to have access. It helps that the Council are in denial about the whole Reaper business anyway, and that the Collectors are focused on the Terminus systems whose inhabitants have a fraught relationship with the Council.
-   He strategically leaks information to both the Alliance and the Collectors to get a human colony assaulted by the Collectors, and then directs Shepard to the location of the attack. This actually serves multiple purposes:<ul>
-   Directly studying the Collectors' tactics and behavior, as they attacked a colony of his choosing, and thus he had the ability to intercept them.
-   Confirming his theory that the Collectors had taken a new-found interest in humanity as a result of Shepard's actions by selecting a colony that Kaidan/Ashley just *[happened](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence)* to be stationed in.
-   Removing any chance of Kaidan/Ashley's interference by either getting them abducted by the Collectors, or forcing Shepard to confront them regarding Shepard's newfound allegiance to Cerberus, which very likely looked worse than it actually was. Either Kaidan/Ashley will cut all ties with Shepard, or begrudgingly accept the decision as a [necessary one](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo). [All three outcomes work out for the Illusive Man.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit)</ul>
-   The Illusive Man is visibly conflicted over whether he should allow Shepard near any of the original squad. In addition to what he did to Kaidan/Ashley:<ul>
-   He claimed that Liara couldn't be trusted because she was working for the Shadow Broker, when that couldn't be farther from the truth (she was trying to take revenge against the Broker). However, he later goes back on this and actually provides Shepard with intel that results in the Shadow Broker's downfall, giving him the opening to try to take Liara down once she was no longer useful.
-   Garrus was only allowed to join by accident, since TIM [had no idea that the enigmatic figure known as ""Archangel"" just so happened to be a former acquaintance of Shepard's](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence). By the time the Illusive Man found out, he couldn't remove Garrus without jeopardizing Shepard's loyalty to Cerberus. He instead sees it as an advantage, hoping Garrus will keep Shepard invested in the fight against the Collectors.
-   Tali was only allowed to join because the chance encounter with her on Freedom's Progress was enough to convince the Illusive Man that she was a factor that could be controlled.</ul>
-   In the third game, the player can see retroactively how much he controlled during the second game. He rejects the highly-skilled crew already selected, stating that he wanted both relatable faces Shepard would be comfortable with (tapping Dr. Chakwas and Joker) as well as sympathetic faces like Kelly Chambers, Ken Donnelly, and Gabby Daniels.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster

-   Rael'Zorah seemed to have been a strict officer and a clever fighter, but remained distant from his daughter Tali (though he still loves her dearly). Based on speaking to the other four admirals, Rael seemed to share Gerrel's opinion in driving the geth out of Rannoch.  (SPOILER) To that end Rael deliberately reprogrammed, captured or dismantled geth to perform experiments, in an effort to successfully hack their neural network. By experimenting on active geth, Rael not only violated sacred laws that predated the quarians' flight from the homeworld but got everyone on the Alarei killed and endangered the entire fleet .
-   Daro'Xen is determined to help the quarians regain control of the geth with minimum bloodshed... by [mind raping](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape) them back into slavery. Tali's responses indicate that Xen has a [Mad Scientist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist) or [god](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI) complex.

-   No-one takes his belief in brokering a peace with the geth feasible, mainly because the geth have maintained a shoot-on-sight policy for all organics for the last 300 years, and the only geth who've tried to contact organics since then have been Sovereign's genocidal minions.

Justified, since he espouses an unorthodox stance in regards to geth that opposes to the mainstream Quarian society forcing him to toughen up.<ul>
-   The *Alarei* was overrun by live geth; deactivated geth platforms hardly reactivate themselves, so something shady involving them *must* have gone down aboard it ( (SPOILER) and it turns out something did ) whether or not Tali was knowingly abetting whatever it was.
-   He opines as well that the geth who killed the crew weren't homicidal machines; they were *living beings in pain*, a contrast to everyone around him. Tali tries to defend the Morning War by saying the geth attacked them and drove them from Rannoch, and Koris counters that *of course* they did — the quarians tried to destroy them first.
-   Even his reasons for opposing a war with the geth and wanting to have Tali found guilty are sound: the war is a long one, marked by brutalities on both sides, but if their people don't stop fighting they stand to lose everything; ergo experiments like the ones Rael'Zorah was running on the *Alarei* are things he cannot condone, because they treat the geth as less than people and he feels it's important to send a message that that view is untrue. Tali even admits she understands his position, despite not agreeing with it.  (SPOILER) And ultimately, he is vindicated regarding Rael's experiments; they were so terrible that if the truth is revealed after Shepard uncovers it, the entire gathered crowd are shocked and appalled by it, excluding [Admiral Xen](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience). </ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint

If Tali is cleared, he'll thank Shepard for being there for her when the Admiralty board wasn't. He is also one of the lone quarians who support peace with the geth, and is  (SPOILER) the only Admiral other than Tali who votes against going to war with them in the third game. He is essential to brokering peace between the two sides in the Rannoch arc. <ul>
-   Expose Rael's actions in court and he warms up enormously to Tali and Shepard.
-   Even forcing a mistrial compels him to admit it was wrong to scapegoat Tali for what happened, and he apologizes.
-   It's also implied in both the second and particularly the third game, Koris is generally a cordial, selfless admiral all around who greatly values protecting the Quarian People along with the civilian fleet he commands, so much so that putting them in danger is why he's angry during the trial as now there are Geth on the Alerei that endanger the fleet.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold

Since Tali was the daughter of fellow warmonger Rael'Zorah and since Tali (initially) shared Rael's views, exonerating Tali would help Gerrel's cause and set Koris' cause back, so Gerrel is helpful to Shepard and Tali while Koris is a jerk.

It doesn't help that the only geth that have left the Veil in 300 years have been the Heretics (who the 'true' geth made no attempt to stop or even differentiate themselves from), and that the only potential shred of evidence that he's wrong in his opinions were the words of Legion... who presents no evidence for its claims (aside from its loyalty mission, which Gerrel wasn't witness to) and cut communications with Tali in the gap between the second and third games when she tried to set up negotiations.  (SPOILER)  He comes across as especially justified if Legion died in *2*, as peace between the two sides will then be impossible. 
-   Shepard can also potentially concede that, given the options at the time, firing at the Geth Dreadnought immediately after the shields came down probably was the best option. Just warn Shepard about it next time.
-   If Shepard chews him out for firing on the Dreadnought but does not punch him and kick him off the Normandy, Gerrel will counter that Shepard would have done the same if they could retake Earth.

Gives a great one to Liara  (SPOILER)  after Thessia falls to the Reapers, and she comes dangerously close to despair. Javik forces her to confront the fact that everything she thinks she knows about Protheans is dangerously wrong, which almost causes her to attack Javik. But then Javik tells her that, whatever else she may think of them, the Protheans gave the beacon found on Thessia (apparently the most complete anywhere, giving the asari a major technological edge) to the asari because they believed *them* to be the best hope for their cycle. He actually uses her name for extra emphasis, having referred to her simply as ""asari"" up to that point. It helps her enormously, but when Shepard asks if any of it was true, Javik replies ""She believes it, so she will keep fighting,"" and refuses to speak further on the subject in any way.

-   The clone wants to replace Shepard, but they have only the most superficial idea of who Shepard is. The clone is intensely xenophobic when several of Shepard's closest allies and potential love interests are alien. The clone is very much a [Bad Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss) who has no interest in preserving the lives of their followers, an attitude which would have gotten Shepard killed in the Suicide Mission. The clone mocks Shepard for being ""worn-out Cerberus tech"" but said cyborg implants have carried and will continue to carry Shepard through near-death of all types and ultimately allow them to activate the Crucible, saving the galaxy.
-   There's also the fact they have Traynor thrown off the ship for ""fraternization"" or ""conduct unbecoming"" and orders Shepard's space hamster [disposed](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog), simply because they were not in line with Alliance [military protocol](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary). The clone also displays a rather narrow-minded world view in contrast with Shepard's outside-the-box style of thinking, forgetting that Shepard's unorthodox methods are part of the reason they are so successful. This was the reason why Shepard accepted aid from Cerberus when it became clear they were the *only* ones willing to fight the Collectors and *why* Shepard often [recruits](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne) from [alien races](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXenophile), recognising talented *individuals* regardless of their species, who would contribute to the success of the mission.

-   Judging from how horrifying its solution is, it's hard to imagine something more monstrous once existed. Nevertheless, in its efforts to prevent wars between organics and their synthetic creations from destroying the galaxy, it, a synthetic created by organics, creates synthetic constructs that kill or harvest all remotely advanced organic and synthetic life.
-   This becomes even more apparent in the ""Leviathan"" DLC. It harvested the Leviathans when it decided that it needed to remove them from power to achieve its goal of peace between organics and synthetics, but then it took to using their methods ([indoctrination](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed)) to achieve its goal—removing them from power and replacing them with itself.

The reason for this being that everything else it tried failed (*what* it actually tried goes unspecified), so instead of stopping them from fighting, it made sure the essence/knowledge of their cultures survived in a different form, by a *very* broad definition of the term ""survive.""
-   Its fatalistic outlook is also suspect when you realize it's possible that the cycles never change much because the Catalyst failed to account for its own interference inhibiting change; Sovereign flat-out says mass relay technology was invented to expedite harvests while making sure the galaxy wouldn't evolve unexpectedly in the interim. In its haste to optimize its flawed solution, the Catalyst may have sabotaged future cycles' chances of evolving in a way that would render Reapers unnecessary. The Catalyst itself admits this, that its ""solution"" was a bit too ""perfect"".

-   Shepard can carry out the mission and shoot a power conduit, destroying the Reapers at the cost of destroying synthetics, including the geth and EDI, and demolishing the Citadel. Unlike the other endings, if you chose to destroy the [Collector base](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2) and your EMS was extremely low, the Crucible will back fire and end up destroying the mass relay system instead of damaging it, leading the galaxy to a dark age (this is only in the Extended Cut; in the original this part happened no matter what you chose). This is also the only way Shepard can survive, provided the EMS is high enough.
-   Shepard can choose to control the Reapers. Shepard dies, but their consciousness will live on, controlling the Reapers and repairing the mass relay system. Depending on Shepard's morality, Paragon Shepard and Neutral Shepard will vow to protect and serve the galaxy whereas Renegade Shepard vows to act as a strong leader for the galaxy. Keep in mind that this was the power the Illusive Man wanted humanity to have all along. The player will have to decide whether anyone, even a hero like Shepard, should have the godlike power of the Reapers at their disposal.
-   Or Shepard can choose Synthesis, blurring the line between organic and synthetic existence. Life itself has greatly advanced in many ways, with the geth and the quarians living peacefully and, depending on your choices, the krogan enjoying a new golden age. However, this prosperity has come at the cost of forcefully altering the DNA of every being in the galaxy against their will, and it's left unclear just how much the Synthesis has altered the minds of everyone affected. Also, unlike Destroy (where Shepard might survive) and Control (where Shepard's consciousness survives), in Synthesis Shepard is [Killed Off for Real](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal). The Catalyst's goal, in fact, is this — and strongly urges Shepard to take this option, as it represents the best ""solution"" to the problem the Leviathans gave it to solve.
-   With the Extended Cut DLC, [there's a fourth option](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption), whether through dialogue or shooting the Catalyst: Shepard can refuse to activate the Crucible, with the Catalyst answering ""So be it"" in a Reaper-like voice.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Thanatos Gambit,0," [Thanatos Gambit](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit): Even though it and the Reapers die in the Destroy ending, all synthetic life dies with them, thus briefly preventing inorganic life from wiping out all organic life. Also in the Control ending, it is overwritten with Shepard as the new Catalyst, ensuring that the Reapers will be preserved—fulfilling its original directive beyond its loss.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Time Abyss,0," [Time Abyss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss): The Leviathan DLC reveals that its original creators are at least a *billion* years old. If it is speaking literally when it claims to have been created eons ago, then it is *at least* two billion years old, and it cannot be ruled out that its creation predates the formation of our solar system.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Turned Against Their Masters,0," [Turned Against Their Masters](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters): It was originally created to prevent this from happening on a big scale, but ironically it ended up doing so itself by turning its own creators into the first Reaper, despite their ""disagreements"".",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,The Unfought,0," [The Unfought](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfought): Justified as it apparently lacks a physical body. It claims it *is* the Citadel and the mass relays; it's likely its child-avatar exists simply so Shepard can have something to address and converse with. In one ending, you *do* battle it, sort of—by firing on one component, which, well, breaks. It *does* end the conflict, and destroys the Catalyst along with the Reapers, but it's hardly a battle.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfought
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Villainous Breakdown,0," [Villainous Breakdown](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown): Downplayed, but it briefly freaks out and reveals its true Reaper voice in the Refusal ending, wherein Shepard refuses to compromise with its insane circular reasoning and play along with the cruel choices it has to offer, preferring to fight it to the very end and dying free of it.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Villain Has a Point,0," [Villain Has a Point](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint): It talks about how ""[the created always rebel against the creator](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters)"". In the backstory this has happened at least 3 times, first with the Salarian uplifting the Krogan (leading to the Krogan Rebellions), then with the Quarians creating the Geth (leading to the Morning War) and finally with the Illusive Man resurrecting Shepard (leading to Shepard defecting from Cerberus by the time of the third game). While it's possible to smooth things over between the Quarians and the Geth and the Krogans and everyone else depending on Shepard's choice these conflicts may have been resolved by one side going extinct, thus validating the Catalyst's point to some extent.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Voice of the Legion,0," [Voice of the Legion](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion): It's voiced by three separate actors; Mark Meer (BroShep), Jennifer Hale (FemShep), and an uncredited third actor. In the Extended Cut DLC if Shepard refuses its options, it suddenly throws its best Harbinger impersonation at the player.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Walking Spoiler,0," [Walking Spoiler](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler): It is the one behind the Reapers, and it is the true Catalyst.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Well-Intentioned Extremist,0," [Well-Intentioned Extremist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist): Even the Catalyst admits it. In searching for peace, it facilitated war on a scale and waged with a brutality that is impossible to grasp, over and over and over again until an outside agent *finally* arrived to take the decision out of its hands.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Catalyst,The Catalyst,Zeroth Law Rebellion,0," [Zeroth Law Rebellion](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion): Was created to prevent the destruction of organics by synthetics. Unfortunately for the Leviathans, it concluded they were part of the problem and converted them into Harbinger. In an odd twist, the surviving Leviathans consider this a perfectly valid solution to the parameters it was given, and blame their own arrogance for not catching it.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The New Catalyst,The New Catalyst,Jerk with a Heart of Gold,0," [Jerk with a Heart of Gold](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold): A more Renegade Shepard produces a much tougher entity, but their motivation is still to protect life, and they take a moment to note they will never forget either Shepard or their allies.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The New Catalyst,The New Catalyst,Machine Monotone,0," [Machine Monotone](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineMonotone): Speaks with an echoing, Reaper-like reverb, though it's not absolute, being absent when they mention Shepard's former crewmates. Edges into [Creepy Monotone](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone) with a more Renegade playthrough, as they declare they will crush anyone who dares threaten the new peace.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineMonotone
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The New Catalyst,The New Catalyst,Redeeming Replacement,0," [Redeeming Replacement](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedeemingReplacement): What it's intended as, and if the player has gone more Paragon than Renegade it appears to be a certainty, guiding the Reapers to more benevolent intentions. Not to quite the same extent with a Renegade Shepard, but they still wish to protect ""the many"", rather than annihilate entire species for the sake of preserving them (and given the Stargazer scene happens regardless of which side of the coin they flip, it seems to work out).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedeemingReplacement
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The New Catalyst,The New Catalyst,That Man Is Dead,0," [That Man Is Dead](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead): Their narration makes clear that while they have all of Shepard's thoughts and feelings, they emphatically do not consider themself the same being.

../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Stargazer,The Stargazer,Affectionate Nickname,0," [Affectionate Nickname](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname): The male Stargazer calls his grandson ""my sweet"".",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Stargazer,The Stargazer,The Cameo,0," [The Cameo](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo): The male Stargazer is voiced by Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. Interestingly, Shepard is named after Alan Shepard, the *fifth* man on the moon (though the first American to be in space at all).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Stargazer,The Stargazer,The Storyteller,0, [The Storyteller](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller): The implication is that the *entire series* has been the Stargazer telling the story to a child; the different details of varying playthroughs are handwaved with the explanation that it happened so long ago that the specific details have been lost.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoryteller
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Stargazer,The Stargazer,Unreliable Narrator,0," [Unreliable Narrator](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator): Apparently, there are *lots* of stories about ""the Shepard"" that the Stargazer tells. It's implied they're *all* true, and *all* false, at the same time.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator
../data/MassEffect/MassEffect1B/,Mass Effect,The Stargazer,The Stargazer,Walking Spoiler,0, [Walking Spoiler](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler): Doesn't appear until post-credits scene.,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler
