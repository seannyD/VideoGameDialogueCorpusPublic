They replaced the building after that, but ... there's more to it, too. Around that time, a lot of students stopped coming to school. Maybe that's why they put up the new building ... to start with a clean slate ..."

A power that takes many forms, yet is bound by none ... it may prove to be your salvation, depending on where you end up.",
