# Persona 3

This is a fan trascript, based on:

The author claims:

>  This script contains all the mandatory conversations in the game, as well as all of the optional/NPC dialog based on when it changes. At present, I am missing a very small amount of the main game's dialog (from missing a couple of choice outcomes) and it may be possible that I missed some of the NPC dialog as well. 

Also:

>  Almost all of the NPCs have very generic names. I have given many of them alternate names here so that you can easily know who is talking.

However, the social links seem to be missing. Those are available here:

This is taken from the original parsing of Persona 3.
