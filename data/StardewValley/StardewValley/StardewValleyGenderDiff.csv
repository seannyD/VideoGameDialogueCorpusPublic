Alex,Male,"Hey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt.",Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going.,41,45,21,Gender-specific flirting,Flirts with female. This is weird. Why is a tan nice on a girl but not on a guy?

Leah,Female,@'s a better man than you in every respect!,@'s a better person than you in every respect!,43,46,5,Perpetuate,"Presumably the person being compared to is also a man, but it's interesting that they've defaulted to a 'better man' when possible, rather than just using 'better person' for both.

Gus,Male,"Oh, Hello there, buddy.","Hi, @.",23,6,19,Neutral,"There are various possible implications here, but it's hard to tell out of context.
